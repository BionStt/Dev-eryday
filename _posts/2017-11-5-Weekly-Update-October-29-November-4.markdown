So I finished the [React Nanodegree][rnd] this week. I already wrote a few quick thoughts about the program [here][fin]. It's a solid program and I'm glad that I completed it. I'm planning to do a deeper dive into the Nanodegree's content sometime this month.

After finishing the React Nanodegree it was time to get back into my focus on building web APIs using .NET Core. Shawn Wildermuth's [Implementing and Securing an API with ASP.NET Core][core] course has been in my "Currents" section for way too long. I finally got a chance to complete it this week. It's an amazing course, probably the best coverage I've seen on building an API with .NET Core. It clearly, and quickly, demonstates the usability of the toolset.

Finished

On the Next...
--------
I'm going to keep on pushing forward. I want to get back into *Tao of Seneca: Volume 3* this week. Reading Seneca's work is always sobering. It's amazing how much of his advice is directly applicable to the world of today. Not much has changed in 2000 years. The world around us may change but humans are still humans. It's time to dig deeper into his ancient wisdom.
