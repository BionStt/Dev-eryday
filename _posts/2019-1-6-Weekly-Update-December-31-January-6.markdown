It was a pretty good first week of the year. I laid down some intentions and got the year started on the right track. One of the best things I did this week was starting Martin Fowler's *[Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code (2nd Edition)][rf2]*. The 2nd edition of the classic book on the practice of refactoring came out recently and I'm super excited to be reading it. I'm through a couple of chapters now and it's as good as advertised. The first chapter works through a refactoring on a small piece of code that calculates bill amounts and prints invoices for a play performance organization. The second chapter discusses the types of refactoring, reasons to refactor, and times where refactoring might not be needed.

I quickly read through *[Finding Ultra][fu]* by Rich Roll. Roll shares his saga from out of shape to competing in ultra-endurance competitions. It's a truly enjoyable read. It's got me wanting to run a marathon this year. Roll also has a great [podcast][rrp] that is definitely worth checking out.

## Finished

**Online Course(s):** [Dependency Injection On-Ramp][dior]

**Book(s):** *[Finding Ultra][fu]*

## On the Next...

I'm going to keep reading through *Refactoring*. I might even get my hands on the  *[Refactoring Workbook][https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Workbook-William-C-Wake/dp/0321109295] if I get far enough.
