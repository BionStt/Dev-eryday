My challenge to run 100 miles in the month of September continued this week. I'm solidly on pace to complete it. I ran a little more than a half marathon on Saturday. It was 13.75 miles and it took 2 hours even. I'm pretty sure it this was the longest run I've ever completed. I finished first in the race. I was the only participant though. That run and the other runs from this week puts me at a monthly total of 83.75 miles. I only need to run 17 more miles to complete the challenge.

I finished up _[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]_ this week. It's a great overview of many of the best practices for automating a robust delivery process for any software project. I wrote up a summary of the concepts introduced in part one [here][po], check it out. I may add some summaries for parts two and three at some point. Since the book came out, there have been a number of online services that have sprung up that make continuous delivery easier. With tools like [Travis CI][ti], [Azure Pipelines][ap], and many others it's the perfect time to automate your delivery process. The idea I got the most out of from the book was treating configuration settings as importantly as code. Configuration files should be tracked in source control if possible. Overall, I recommend the book.

## On the Next...

My first order of business for the next week is to run at least 17 miles. As mentioned above, I need 17 miles to complete 100 miles ran in the month of September. 17 miles should be a walk in the park, as I've averaged over 20 miles a week so far during the challenge, so this week should be a little easier. Once I've wrapped up the 100 miles, I'll need to decide on a challenge for October.

On top of the running, I'll be writing code and learning each day.
