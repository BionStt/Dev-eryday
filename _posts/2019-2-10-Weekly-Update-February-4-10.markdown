You know what's a cool technology? [GraphQL][gq]. I've had this thought before, but it was reinforced this week while I was working through [Building GraphQL APIs with ASP.NET Core][gql]. The course gives a quick overview of how to use GraphQL within ASP.NET Core. It showcases how to build a GraphQL API, consume the API, and use mutations. It's a brief course too. Several months ago, I used GraphQL in a project built with [NextJS][next] and [Apollo][ap]. In the time that's passed since that project I forgot how much fun it was to use GraphQL. I wouldn't call it a revolutionary step forward, but it does provide a great option for interacting with APIs. I'm looking forward to using it soon, possibly in a [Gatsby][gat] project.

I think it's safe to say that I enjoy a good book about investing. Upon counting, I've read no fewer than five books on Warren Buffet or Charlie Munger alone. There's something about investing stories that's just so captivating. This week I got my fill of investment stories and then some in reading *[Market Wizards, Updated: Interviews with Top Traders][mw]*.  The book, first published in 1989, shares stories and insights from some of the most successful investors in history. Some common themes can be found in their stories. For the most part, the traders made a lot of missteps but learned from their mistakes. Through their mistakes they learned to cut their losses early and to be emotionally unattached to their trades. The ups and downs of trading make it a game that's best played without emotion. The stories are interesting and informational.

## On the Next...

I'm going to finish [CSS - The Complete Guide (incl. Flexbox, Grid & Sass)][css] this week. I also going to read a chapter of *[Code Complete 2][cc]* each day. I've been reading the book for what feels like forever now but I'm only through chapter 8. It's an absolutely massive book. Therefore, it's essential to pick up the pace a little bit. I want to have it done before February is over.
