I was able to finish the [Getting Started with ASP.NET Core and OAuth][core2] course on Pluralsight. The course provides a practical look at how to use [IdentityServer4][is4] with ASP.NET Core. IdentityServer4 makes it easy to produce authentication functionality in ASP.NET Core projects using OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. On top of showing the ins and outs of how to use IdentityServer4, it also shows how to integrate Google Authentication and Auth0 into the mix. It's a very cool course and I'll be using its content to build some cool stuff.

I didn't work on the [Mobile FlashCards][mf] app nearly as much as I thought I would this week. With all the playoff baseball I didn't get to focus on it like I thought I would. It happens. The Cubs winning their series versus the Nationals was a double edged sword. On one hand I'm happy that they won the series, but on the other hand if they had lost I would've had more time to produce and learn. Either way it's a good situation to have. I will carve out a little more time this week and make progress on the app.
