Right now I'm trying to learn Jekyll so I can start my Dev-eryday project. It's going fairly well so far. Last night I spent a good amount of time setting up a development environment. I'll write about that experience in the next post. For now, here's the plan and what I'm currently doing to get acquainted with Jekyll.

I'm using [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] and the basic "jekyll new" command template to learn the system. If the docs don't take my skills where I want them to be, I plan on checking out the source for [GitHub Training][github-training-source]. I also found a nice looking Pluralsight course, [Static Websites with Jekyll][pluralsight-course], that could be useful.

[jekyll-docs]: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home
[github-training-source]: https://github.com/github/training-kit
