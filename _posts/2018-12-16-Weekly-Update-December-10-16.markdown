I'm just going to do a quick update this week. Sorry, no picture. This week I started winding down for a nice break to close out the year. I'll still be learning every day, and carrying out dev-eryday, but the main focus will be on relaxing and taking in the holidays. It's been a long year and it's time now for a little reflection, a lot of relaxation, some fun, and planning out the year(s) to come.

Up until 12/13, I was participating in [Advent of Code 2018][aoc]. I got a day behind after struggling with day 12. I eventually got day 12 (always simplify), but skipped day 13, got day 14, then skipped day 15 after reading the problem description. Since I'm rolling into vacation, I don't know if I'm going to pick it back up right now. I might solve a few problems over the next few weeks, but I don't plan on solving all of them. The problems are great exercises and a lot of fun sometimes, but I'd rather focus on more productive coding. I'd say solving toy problems like these once a week would be the perfect amount. Solving them every day is too much for me.

I've got the week off so I'm going to take it easy. I'll spend time with family, reading, working out, and maybe even carve out some time to work some side projects. It's going to be a great week.
