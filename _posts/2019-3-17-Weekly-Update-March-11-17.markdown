Another week in the books, it's hard to believe we're already half way through March. With the time change last Sunday, it's been strange adjusting to how late the sun goes down. All of the sudden, it feels like the sun is always out. The memories of walking home from work in the dark back in December and January are long gone as the sun is shining well past 7 PM now. It's nice to have so much daylight, but it's been a rough transition as far as getting to sleep on time so far.

I had a good week of learning. As far as books are concerned, I started reading *[Get Programming with F#: A Guide for .NET Developers][fs]* and completed *[Programming on Purpose][pop]*. On the course side of the fence, I watched [Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core][di] and started viewing [Getting Started with Dependency Injection in .NET][depn]. The ASP.NET Core course gives a great look into using the default container provided by the framework to implement DI. My focus on dependency injection, a set of concepts that help developers avoid loosely coupled code, is due to a new version of *[Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns][dip]* being released on March 16. I don't have the new version of the book yet, but I'm excited about it. The new version promises a lot of updates in addition to new content. I want to have the concepts back in mind prior to getting started with the new book so I started reviewing the basic DI concepts. 

## Finished

**Online Course(s):** [Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core][di]

**Book(s):** *[Programming on Purpose][pop]*

## Currents

**Online Course(s):** [Getting Started with Dependency Injection in .NET][depn]

**Book(s):** *[The Brothers Karamazov: A Novel in Four Parts][brk]*, *[Get Programming with F#: A Guide for .NET Developers][fs]*

## On the Next...

I'm going to keep on working through the F# book this week. It feels good writing code in F#, but I'm still a novice with it at best. It's too early to say that I'll be spending significant time with the language in the future, but it's clear that the language is expanding my horizons on functional programming. Immutability by default is something that takes some getting used to. I have a lengthy list of books, articles, and tasks I want to bight off using F# following *[Get Programming with F#][fs]*.  It'd be nice to see them all through.
