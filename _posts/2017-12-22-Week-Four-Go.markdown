Week four, let's Go! It's time for week four of the [Five Languages in Five Weeks][fnf] challenge. Weeks one through three, covering [TypeScript][ts], [Elixir][ex], and [Haskell][hs], have come and gone and it's time to move on to [Go][go]. I'll be learning Go from December 22, 2017 to Thursday, December 28, 2017. I'm going to dive right in and write code in Go everyday over the next week. I will also be reading articles and book about the language and taking courses over it on [Pluralsight][ps]. It's going to be a great time.

### Why Go?
Go has a lot to offer. It was developed by Google and created by, among others, famous developers [Rob Pike][pike] and [Ken Thompson][ken]. The language was created to solve big problems at Google's scale. Go has a clean and modern syntax that is at once familiar to people who have used any C-based programming language. I feel like Go will be a nice language to get comfortable with over the holidays this week. After learning Elixir and Haskell the last two weeks, Go will provide a nice relaxing week of learning.

### Planned Projects
I've planned out a few projects that I intend to complete using Go. These projects are based primarily on those completed during the previous weeks of the challenge ([week 1][repots], [week 2][repoex],[week 3][repohs]). None of these projects are too large, but they will serve well as an introduction to the language. I would like to complete a decent sized project using the language, but I don't know how reasonable that would be at this point. I haven't completed any big projects yet, but maybe I will this week with all the extra time off due to the holidays. I'll just have to see how the week plays out and see how far I get.

Here are the projects that I've planned out so far.

**[HelloGo][hg]** - A hello world program written in Go.  
**[LanguageFeatures][lf]** - This project exists to demonstrate essential features of the language.  
**[RosettaCode][rc]** - Code written to compare the styles of all languages. The goal is to implement the same code accross each language.  
**[TestingGo][tt]** - Project created to get familiar with automated testing using Go.  

### Repo
All of the code I write in the process of learning Go will be published on GitHub. The repository is called [FiveInFive-Go][repogo]. 

### Installation Process
So far, each of the other languages have been installed via [brew][brew]. This made getting up to speed extremely easy. I bet there is a brew package for installing Go, but I went ahead and used the pkg provided [here][install]. It was a very easy install.

```
download pkg/msi
install via onscreen wizard
test installation
```

### Thoughts Coming Into the Language
Go seems to be a language on the rise. Since it was created and maintained by Google, Google has a vested interest in its success. This alone will make the language always have a relatively high base level of support. There has been some major growth in its use over the last few years. A major area where Go has been successful is in development of container software.  Specifically, [Docker][dock] and [kubernetes][kn] have showed that Go is a ready for the big stage. I'm excited to get a taste of why Go has been so successful since it was first released in 2009.
