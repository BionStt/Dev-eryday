Another week, another great course on Pluralsight. I worked through Vladimir Khorikov's newest content, [Domain-Driven Design: Working with Legacy Projects][ddd]. There's some excellent material here. Throughout the course Khorikov takes a legacy application then extends and modifies it using practices from domain driven design. The key concept that makes all of the refactorings possible is an anticorruption layer. The anticorruption layer allows us to work on new features without impacting the old ones by creating a way to map from one version to the other.

Beyond the Domain Driven Design course I also finished another couple of quick courses on Pluralsight. The first was [Visual Studio for Mac][vsm]. It gave a nice overview of Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE offering from the Mac operating system. The IDE is not quite as powerful as the Windows release but is a great option for any .NET developer interested in using a Mac. The other course I went through was [Play by Play: Modern Web Security Patterns][wsp]. This course talked about a number of tricks web developers can use to increase the safety of their web-based systems. My favorite part was the coverage of content security policies, a way to define the allowed origins of resources allowed on your web pages. CSPs are typically used to prevent Cross Site Scripting attacks. 

## Finished

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Domain-Driven Design: Working with Legacy Projects][ddd], [Visual Studio for Mac][vsm], [Play by Play: Modern Web Security Patterns][wsp]

**Book(s):** *[East of Eden][eden]*

## Currents

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [React 16 - The Complete Guide][re], [Encapsulation and SOLID][sol]

**Book(s):** *[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]*

## On the Next...

Having finally finished reading *East of Eden*, it's time to move away from fiction and back into reading a technical book. Therefore, I'm starting to read *[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]* week. The praise coming from reviews over on Amazon is overwhelming and it looks like a great book. In today's world having a continuous delivery system set up for team's project can make a huge difference in terms of delivery agility. It looks like there are a number of valuable lessons to be taken away from the book.
