Tony Hsieh is an insanely successful person. His book, *[Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose][hap]*, is a fun read that details the events, beliefs, and practices that got him where he is today. From starting LinkExchange to leading Zappos to a $1.2 billion exit from Amazon, Hsieh has had a wild ride. Selling shoes on the internet isn't something that instantly sounds like a billion-dollar idea. Zappos was so successful due to its focus on culture and customer service. The book, which is a great read, features the 10 core values of Zappos. I think they're worth sharing. Each of these core values align well with Dev-eryday and are worth striving for individually, not just within the context of Zappos. Here they are.

1. Deliver WOW Through Service
2. Embrace and Drive Change
3. Create Fun and a Little Weirdness
4. Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded
5. Pursue Growth and Learning
6. Build Open and Honest Relationships with Communication
7. Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit
8. Do More with Less
9. Be Passionate and Determined
10. Be Humble

From a technical standpoint, I spent some time with [Securing ASP.NET Core 2 with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect][oat]. It's a good overview of how to integrate modern authentication and authorization technologies, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, with ASP.NET Core web applications and web services. This was an updated version of another course I've taken before so there was a good deal of overlap, but it was nice review. On top of that, I started reading *[Functional Programming in C#: How to Write Better C# Code][fun]*. I'm only a chapter in, but so far so good.

## Finished

## On the Next...

Momentum. It's the last full week of July this week, and I've decided it's time to start building momentum. I want to build momentum on the things that are important to me. Time moves fast and there's only so much available to each of us. From a Dev-eryday standpoint, I want to focus on the quality of the skills I accumulate over the quantity. It's nice to know a little bit about a lot of things, but the depth of knowledge is where real progress happens. On top of skills, it's time to focus on releasing projects. The goal for next week is to build momentum towards depth of knowledge and on releasing a project.

On a more tangible note, I'm looking forward to reading more of *[Functional Programming in C#: How to Write Better C# Code][fun]*. I'm excited for the week to come, it's going to be a good one.
