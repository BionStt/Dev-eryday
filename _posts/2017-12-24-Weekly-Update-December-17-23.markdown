The end of the year is practically here. There is only one more week of the first year of Dev-eryday. It's amazing how quickly it's gone by. It feels like just yesterday I purchased the domain name and set up the original site. The practice hasn't always been fun, but the process has been overwhelmingly valuable to me. My committment to improving every single day set the tone for my entire year. Taking on the challenge of Dev-eryday led to an openness in taking on even more challenges. It's been a rewarding year. I'm planning to build on the success and lessons learned in 2017 to make 2018 even better.

This week I finished week three of the [Five Languagues in Five Weeks][fnf] challenge covering [Haskell][hs]. It was interesting to learn the basics of Haskell. I don't think I'll be digging in further into the language but it was fun to use it for a little a bit. I also started week four of the challenge covering [Go][g]. I'm really enjoying my first look at Go so far. The language offers a high level of comfort on jumping in.

On the Next...
--------
Christmas is this week. I might breeze through a couple of days to get a little bit of a break. I definitely take in the holidays and limit the amount of time devoted to projects. When I'm working, I'm going to continue learning Go. On Friday the fifth and final week of the Five in Five challenge will start up. I'll begin learning [Swift][swi] at that point. I was originally planning to learn [Kotlin][kt] in week five but the draw of Apple's Swift was too strong to ignore. I'm looking forward to spending time with Swift.
