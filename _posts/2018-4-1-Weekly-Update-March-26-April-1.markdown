The 2018 Major League Baseball season started up this week. That means that my focus on Dev-eryday will take a back seat for a little while. I will still have a lot of time to to move forward with my extracurriculars though, just not as much as I have during the offseason. My favorite team, the Chicago Cubs, started their season off in style by beating the Miami Marlins. 2018 is shaping up to be another good year for the Cubs. I'm predicting they'll win 98+ games and could win their second World Series in the last three years. This team looks special.

Beyond baseball, I spent a good amount of time looking through some of the contents in the [awesome-dotnet-core][awe] repo on GitHub. The repo is full of cool links related to .NET Core. It's amazing how much great work the community is creating. We're so lucky as developers today to be able to have such an amazing collection of code available. The only thing bad about lists like this is finding enough time to research all interesting content. I'm sure it'll all be obsolete by the time I get through all of it.

## On the Next...

I'm going to read some fiction this week. I started John Steinbeck's *East of Eden* and it's great so far. Hopefully I'll find the time to finish it this week.

Beyond reading, I've been working on creating the IdeaListz app I've been writing about for what seems like forever. It's going well but I'm only just starting to get momentum on it. The plan is to keep making progress each day and see how far I can get.
