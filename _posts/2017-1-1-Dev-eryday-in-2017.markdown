Well, we made it. 2017 is here. 2016 laid the ground work what's to come, now it's time for the process to get real. My goal is to get better at software development every day in 2017. I'm looking forward to the challenge and can't wait to see what all I'll learn through these efforts.

There will be no days of zero progress. From reading books and articles, to writing posts here, to the actual process of writing code, my focus will be on building valuable skills. In the last week or so I've been on vacation so I've been taking it easy by watching a lot of Pluralsight videos and thinking about clean code. This time has been both fruitful and enjoyable. I'll be ramping up in the next few days to posting content and focusing on writing code.

Happy New Year and welcome to 2017!
