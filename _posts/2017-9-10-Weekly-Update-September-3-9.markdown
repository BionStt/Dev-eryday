I finished the [Readable][read] project. I submitted it twice. On the first attempt, I forgot the "--save" switch when installing react-router-dom so when the reviewer issued "npm start" they experienced an error. After that quick fix, and making a few of the edits recommended in the code review, I was able to resubmit. The second attempt was accepted and I'm now 2/3 done with the [React Nanodegree][rnd]. I'm enjoying the program so far. The second project was a major step forward in my learning the ins and outs of Redux.

On the Next...
--------
This week I'm going to finish a couple Pluralsight courses and get back into reading. I've been watching course content and reading each day but didn't carve out enough time to finish anything last week. It was nice to take a little bit of a break.

For the React Nanodegree, I'm going to spend a lot of time with React Native. The React Native portion of the program is up next and goes live on Tuesday.  I've played with Native a little bit in the past, but I haven't built anything notable with it yet. This will change over the next few weeks.
