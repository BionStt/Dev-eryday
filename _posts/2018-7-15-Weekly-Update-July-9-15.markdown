I've been keeping an eye on [WebAssembly][wa] for quite some time. WebAssembly (Wasm is a compelling story for a lot of developers. The concept is that you can write native code in your language of choice (C#/C++, Rust, etc.) then it gets compiled so that it runs in the Wasm virtual machine. The code can then run natively in the browser. It's really cool. To research it some more, I sped through [WebAssembly: The Big Picture][wap] on Pluralsight. It gives a nice overview of what Wasm is and where it's headed. I've been thinking about playing with [Blazor][blz] for weeks now, I think it's time to dig in.

On the other side of the court, I spent a good amount of time reading  *[When I Stop Talking, You'll Know I'm Dead: Useful Stories from a Persuasive Man][stop]*. This book is unlike a lot of the stuff I typically read as it's the memoir of the late Jerry Weintraub, who was an American film producer. I read *When I Stop Talking* because it was recommended by Elliott Bisnow to Alex Banayan in Banayan's book *The Third Door*. Weintraub's memoir is filled with cool stories about how he left his mark on popular culture over the last 50+ years. Weintraub worked with Elvis, Sinatra, Clooney, and almost everyone in-between. Through everything he did, Weintraub concedes that it's the relationships he forged that allowed him to be so successful.

## On the Next...

It's probably going to be hot this week. That means I'll be spending a good amount of time inside where I'll be reading, learning, and creating. I didn't quite get my [SignalR Chat App][ncp] live yet, but I did make some progress on it over the last week. I'll continue working on it this week and see how far I can get. Outside of that, I'm going to show up to work each day and work hard. I do it each week, it's nothing new, but this week I'm going to call it out. I challenge you to do the same.
