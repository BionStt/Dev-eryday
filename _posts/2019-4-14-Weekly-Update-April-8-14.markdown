I think about time a lot. Mostly it's about how I'm spending my time and whether or not I could be using it more effectively. One night this week, I was burning time aimlessly reading Quora answers when I came across an obvious idea that I hadn't considered before. The post was by the author Ryan Holiday who learned about the idea from another author, Robert Greene. The concept is Alive Time versus Dead Time. Alive Time is when we are working towards something we want, like a goal or intention. Dead Time is when we just letting time pass by, like aimlessly reading online. In any moment we can ask our self  "Is this going to be Alive Time or Dead Time?" The point of asking the question is to realize that it's our choice whether to use the time we've been granted as Alive Time or Dead Time. I enjoyed reading about and thinking about Alive Time vs. Dead This week so I had to share it. For anyone interested in the concept, here's a [post][atdt] where Holiday goes in depth on the topic. It's very similar to the aforementioned Quora post.

I made a good amount of progress on *[Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns][dim]*, but I'm still less than halfway through. I read through the meat of the first version of the text last year, skipping only the content on using specific DI containers, and this second edition is quite an improvement on an already fine text. A lot has changed in terms of technical offerings since the first edition was released in 2011, and the new edition has updated along with the landscape. The primary examples of DI are now using ASP.NET Core and UWP whereas before it showed how to implement DI in standard ASP.NET (MVC and Web Forms), WCF, WPF, and console applications. The conceptual content is first rate, eloquently discussing how to use DI to make your code support late binding, extensible, testable, maintainable, and capable of being worked on by teams of developers.

## Finished

**Online Course(s):** [SOLID Principles for C# Developers][sol]

**Book(s):** *[Find Your Why][fyw]*

## Currents

**Online Course(s):** [ReSharper Fundamentals][rf]

**Book(s):** *[Get Programming with F#: A Guide for .NET Developers][fs]*, *[Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns][dim]*

## On the Next...

I'm going to make an effort to intentionally create more Alive Time. Beyond that, I'm going to continue reading *[Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns][dim]*. I can't wait to learn more about how to avoid anti-patterns, spot code smells, and implement Pure DI. I don't think I'll get to the sections on individual containers, the book covers Autofac, Simple Injector, and .NET Core's Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection container, but I might if I find enough time. I'm also excited about working though [ReSharper Fundamentals][rf]. I recently got a subscription to ReSharper and I want to hit the ground running with it.
