I got caught up on the machine learning class by finishing all the course content. Overall the course was fantastic. There are so many powerful ideas in the subject. I treated the course as a survey of Machine Learning. The course didn't prepare me to start doing work in the field, but I at least have a level of comfort with subject that I didn't have before. A couple of books I'm planning on working through as a follow up are: *[Python Machine Learning][ml1]* and *[Deep Learning][ml2]*.

From a Pluralsight standpoint, my viewing time was all over the map this week. There are so many interesting courses on there that it's hard to pick just one. I started two more .NET Core courses: [Building a RESTful API with ASP.NET Core][rest] and [Getting Started with .NET Core on Mac and Linux][mac]. These courses, in addition to [Implementing and Securing an API with ASP.NET Core][core], are being used to gain insight on setting up the backend for Idealistz. I also started [Advanced JavaScript][js] by Kyle Simpson. I've been on a major JavaScript kick for the last couple of weeks. The language is really starting to show its beauty and I'm going to keep building on this momentum.

Finished
--------
**MOOC Course:** [Machine Learning][ML]

**Book(s):** *[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck][subtle]*

Currents
--------
**PluralSight Course(s):** [Implementing and Securing an API with ASP.NET Core][core], [Building a RESTful API with ASP.NET Core][rest], [Getting Started with .NET Core on Mac and Linux][mac], [Advanced JavaScript][js]

**Book(s):** *[Elements of Programming][ep]*

On the Next...
--------
Hopefully I'll have some time to focus on building Idealistz next week. I've got some deadlines to hit for actual work though so that complicates things a bit. At the end of the day, it's often easier to read or watch training videos than it is to get right back at it writing code. Either way, I'm going to create some ideas, write some good code, and continue learning as much as I can over the next week.
