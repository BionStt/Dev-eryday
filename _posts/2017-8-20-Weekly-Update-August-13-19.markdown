I didn't finish anything this week! I didn't complete any books or courses. I did make progress though. I'm progressing nicely through everything I'm currently working on. I've started actively working on the [readable][read] project from the [React Nanodegree][rnd]. It's coming along nicely but is a lot more difficult and more interesting than the first project.

Beyond the software based stuff, I'm really enjoying reading through *[Tao of Seneca][tao]*, which is a new printing of Seneca's *Moral Letters to Lucilius*. Seneca offers guidance for acting in the world with amazing clarity. It's amazing how much of his advice can be applied directly millenia after he lived. It's an amazing read and I speak more highly of it.

Currents
--------
**Course(s):** [React Nanodegree][rnd]

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Implementing and Securing an API with ASP.NET Core][core], [Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect][secure]

**Book(s):** *[Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns][sbp]*, *[Tao of Seneca][tao]*

On the Next...
--------
I'm planning to continue working on the readable project. It's possible that I'll complete it in the week ahead but there's no rush. I'm enjoying process of developing it and deeply learning the flow of using Redux with React. It's not really important when I complete it, it's only important that I master the material.
