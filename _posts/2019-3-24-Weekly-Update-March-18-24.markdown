It's finally starting to feel like spring. Things aren't turning green yet, but it's coming. I took a step back this week and used the transformation of the seasons to consider "why." Part of the impetus for this was that I read *[Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action][why]* by Simon Sinek. The book is driven by the idea that great companies and leaders build their message around the why, not the how or what. A prime example of a company that is built around their why that the book shares is Apple. Apple wasn't the first company to release an MP3 player, but they were the one that made it ubiquitous after they released the iPod. Apple also wasn't the first company to make a smart phone, but they were the one that made everyone feel like they needed one after they released the iPhone. They made this happen by focusing on why. Sinek was recently on Cal Fussman's [Big Questions][bq] podcast and it's a great listen. On the podcast, Sinek mentioned he has a new book coming out called *[The Infinite Game][ig]*. I can't wait to get my hands on it.

On top of reading this week, I completed another brief course on dependency injection over on Pluralsight. The course is titled [Getting Started with Dependency Injection in .NET][depn] and it's a fun overview of the topic. I was primarily using it as a refresher on the topic before I dive into the new edition of *[Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns][dip]* by Mark Seemann. I read the previous version a while back and would like to go through this version. I understand the process of dependency injection, how to use it, why to use it, and so on, but I want to get to the point where I could build my own container if I had to or extend existing ones. DI is such a fundamental and important concept right now, that I don't want to leave any stones unturned on it.

## On the Next...

So, the 2019 Major League Baseball season is starting up this week. With real games for all 30 teams kicking off this week, I'd be lying if I told you that I expect to spend a ton of time learning or writing code in my spare time. I'm going to make every effort to read, create, and learn, but I won't be disappointed if I don't get far. I will certainly continue working through *[Get Programming with F#: A Guide for .NET Developers][fs]* and write a weekly update post, but I probably won't do much on top of that.
