I'm aiming for a nice quick update this week, let's get right into it. The majority of my course based learning was devoted to completing [CSS - The Complete Guide (incl. Flexbox, Grid & Sass)][css]. The course is a thorough, and long (22 hours), course covering the major concepts of CSS. I primarily watched the course at 2x speed and followed along for a few coding portions. I feel like I'm closer to where I want to be with my CSS knowledge, but I still feel more comfortable using libraries like Bootstrap and Bulma to build my web pages. This course was a big leap forward, and I've already made use of things I've learned from the course. So far, my favorite line of CSS is: `margin: 0 auto;`.

On top of completing the CSS course, I also worked through [Understanding ASP.NET Core 2.x][core]. I'm already pretty knowledgeable on ASP.NET Core, but I wanted to go through a refresher exercise and this course was exactly what I was looking for. The course glides over the main ideas needed to build a web app using ASP.NET Core MVC. My favorite portion was the coverage of [Tag Helpers][th] and [View Components][vc]. Another good feature of the course was that it covered building functionality for both a standard MVC web app and a REST based service via WebAPI. Event was [Razor Pages][rp] being released, I'm liking the direction that the ASP.NET Core team is taking its MVC solution.

Beyond that, I'm going to plug away on a couple of personal projects and keep on learning.
