I spent a lot of time reading this week. The bulk of the reading time was applied to Walter Isaacson's *[Steve Jobs][sj]*, the fantastic, authorized biography of Steve Jobs.  The book has been on my reading list for a long time, but I finally got around to reading it and couldn't put it down. It's a long book, with many details and stories straight from the people involved. The story of Steve Jobs is an incredible journey filled with ups and downs. Jobs, with the help of many talented and driven people, built Apple from nothing to one of the largest, most successful companies of all time. It's an inspiring tale of a brilliant man who made an amazing dent in the universe. The book is one that anyone who enjoys technology or a good story should give a look.

For courses I went through [ReSharper Fundamentals][rf]. The course goes over the main features of the ReSharper Visual Studio extension. I'm seeking to use ReSharper to improve my productivity with writing code using Visual Studio. This course is a nice overview of the tools it offers. I'll need to practice with the features before I'm where I want to be, but the course has me on the right track. The features I'm most excited about are the automatic refactoring and code analysis tools. The code analysis works similarly to how Microsoft Word offers suggestions with the written word, something that can improve any code base.

I'm going to finish *[Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns][dim]* this week. I've devoted a significant amount of time to the book already and I'm really enjoying it. I want to put in the time necessary to complete it this week. It'd be nice to publish some notes over it at some point.
