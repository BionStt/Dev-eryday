It was another good week. I spent a lot of my reading time going through *[Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving][tlp]*. *Think Like a Programmer* is a lot like *[How to Solve It][hsi]*, but instead of talking about how to solve math problems, it provides some heuristics on how to solve programming problems. *Think Like a Programmer* teaches programming problem solving techniques through the lens of C++ but would still be worth reading for people who are programmers but may not be great at C++.  The book would make for great supplemental reading material for any data structures and algorithms class. It also would be a great reference to use for brushing up on programming interview material. I enjoyed the book and solving a few of the example problems included at the end of each chapter.

 From a course standpoint, I finished up [Error Handling in C# with Exceptions][err]. It's a brief course covering exception handling in C#. It's basic but it's good to review exception handling every once in a while. Even on courses covering subjects I know well already, there's always a chance that they'll unearth a feature that I've overlooked or never even knew about. A language as large as C# has become is full tricks and concepts worth knowing about, it's good to cast a wide net to find them.

## Finished

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Error Handling in C# with Exceptions][err]

**Book(s):** *[Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving][tlp]*

## Currents

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [React 16 - The Complete Guide][re]

**Book(s):** _[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]_, *[Functional Programming in C#: How to Write Better C# Code][fun]*

## On the Next...

This week I'm going to get the momentum rolling again. I didn't have much momentum this last week for some reason. I'm going to blame the heat. I'm thinking I'll post at least one new article this week on the site. On top of that, I'm going to work on a programming project. It may not be something that's open source, but I'm going to aim to write code for an hour a day outside of work.
