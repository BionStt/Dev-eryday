It's going to be a short and sweet update this week. My dev-eryday efforts were focused on [Advent of Code][aoc]. There's been nine puzzles released so far, and I've completed all of them. It's been really fun set of programming challenges thus far. I've struggled at times, but it's going smoothly. I don't know if I'll have the time to commit to it each day, but so far, so good. I've even started a repo for my code. You can check it out [here][aocr]. Some code is ugly, but it gets the job done.

From a books standpoint, I completed one new book, *[Joy on Demand: The Art of Discovering the Happiness Within][jod]* by Chade-Meng Tan. It's not about software development, but it's tangentially related. Tan, an engineer at Google, lays out some very practical meditation techniques that anyone can use to make their life more joyful. I've been meditating for years but haven't focused on loving-kindness meditation with any sort of regularity. Now I will be adding several of the meditation exercises from the book into my regular practice. The exercises aim to improve one's control over the four immeasurables: equanimity, love, compassion, and joy. I highly recommend the book for anyone with even a fleeting interest in meditation. A little joy goes a long way.

## On the Next...

This week I'm going to carry on. I want to carve out some time for IdeaListz development. If I don't get to it, it's okay. My main goal is to carry on with Advent of Code for Dev-eryday. On the personal level, my goal is to get through the work week. It's my last work week of 2018. I'll be setting off fireworks at 5:00 PM on 12/14/2018. Until next time, happy coding!
