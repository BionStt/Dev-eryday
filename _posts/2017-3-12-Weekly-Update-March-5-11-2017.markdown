Visual Studio 2017 came out this week. I promptly installed it on both my laptop and desktop. I'm excited for this release of the venerable IDE. Now in its 20th year, Visual Studio has aged gracefully and is one of the nicest development environments around. Check out all the new features and changes that come with Visual Studio 2017 [here][VS]. I'm most excited about some of the improved code navigation features and the quicker load time. Along with the new IDE bits, Microsoft also shipped C# 7.0, F# 4.1, and newer versions of TypeScript and JavaScript. There are lots of new toys to play with!

Beyond playing with Visual Studio 2017, I started putting thoughts together for my new idea list recording application. The tool will be called Idealistz and I've got the domain [www.idealistz.com][IL] registered.

For learning I devoured Douglas Crockford's Javascript: The Good Parts presentation on Pluralsight. The talk was fantastic. The course contains many exercises that test one's ability to write functional code in JS. The section on Monads was exceptional.

On the Next...
--------
I plan to start working on Idealistz in the weeks ahead. The features that get implemented largely rely on the demand for the service. At the very least I intend to build it out far enough so that I can use it as an idea repository.

I need to play catch up on the [Machine Learning][ML] course this week. I didn't put any time into it and will need to get both this and next week's material done.
