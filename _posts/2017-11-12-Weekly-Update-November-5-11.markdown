I finished *[Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design][clean]* this week. The book is a great survey of some important techniques that can be used to create well designed software. Since it's a survey, each section is short and the book scratches the surface on many topics. Though maybe not as good as *[Clean Code][code]*, *Clean Architecture* is a SOLID read.

Towards the end of the week, I finally started learning about [Gatsby][gat]. Gatsby is a static site generator built with React. I had been meaning to get into it for a long time. My first impression after jumping into the official [tutorial][tu] is that Gatsby is impressive and naturally uses skills picked up in React development. I even started a [repo][pwg] to store the code and track my progress.

I will continue playing with Gatsby this week. It would be nice to reimplement Dev-eryday to use it at some point. Dev-eryday is currently using [Jekyll][jek] which has been great, but I never dug into it enough to customize the site. Using the standard Jekyll design has gotten the job done so far, but Gatsby offers a chance to use React and improve the site. Another Gatsby related item I'm excited to get into is [GraphQL][gql]. GraphQL can act as a data layer for within a Gatsby site.
