I had another great week of learning. I powered through the sixth week of the [Machine Learning][ML] course on Coursera. This week's content was focused on machine learning system design and presenting advice on how to approach machine learning problems. Using bias and variance we can modify our algorithm to make better predictions. The key takeaway for me was the idea of building a tiny prototype and testing feasibility of the approach you're planning to use. The prototype should not take long to create and can save lots of time and frustration down the road. Moreover, the practice of building a small test version can be put into practice in software project and is a solid general practice.

The workout feature has been fully integrated into [SimpleHealthTracking][sh]. It was a lot of fun adding the feature in to the system. The workouts entry feature currently on consists of simple CRUD operations but there's potential to do more with it down the road.

From a PluralSight standpoint, I only completed one of the courses I set out to complete. I worked through the C# Internals course. It was a great deep dive into the inner workings for many of the C# features. The course is a little old at this point, the series pre-dates both ROSLYN and .NET Core, but the content that is there is interesting.

For extracurricular reading, I burned through James Altucher's *Reinvent Yourself*. I've read a ton of Altucher's posts on Quora and wanted to support his work by purchasing one of his books. Altucher has a lot of nice ideas and his work stands as a solid companion to Tim Ferriss' *Tools of Titans*.

This week I will finish the React course and hopefully finally start building something new with it. Learning about the React toolset has been a lot of fun so far, I just need to carve out some time to dig into it.
