This week's Machine Learning course subject was Support Vector Machines (SVM). SVMs are a supervised learning technique that can be used to solve classification problems. The homework was a lot of fun but it's getting harder and harder to find the time to work through it.

I finally finished the React and Redux course. It was a nice quick look at how to deliver a web application that uses both React and Redux. Redux seems like the best way to implement React apps moving forward. I need to do a deep review of how the app in the React/Redux course differs from the app developed in the React/Flux course. The next practical step would be to ship some code using React.

Finished
--------
**PluralSight Course(s):** [Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6][React] 

Currents
--------
**MOOC Course:** [Machine Learning][ML]

**PluralSight Course(s):** [LINQ Fundamentals with C# 6.0][linq], [Implementing and Securing an API with ASP.NET Core][core]

**Book(s):** *[Elements of Programming][ep]*, *[Seneca Six Pack][seneca]*

On the Next...

I'm going to try to read more this week. I'm really enjoying going through Seneca's stoic tomes. His moral letters to Lucilius are absolute gold. I hope to finish the Seneca work and dig back into the *Elements of Programming*.

I will likely finish one of the Pluralsight courses, I'm guessing it'll be the LINQ one. It's great so far and is serving as a nice refresher over a subject I've used daily for many years without formally learning.
