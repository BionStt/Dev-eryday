I did it. I've finally completed *[Code Complete 2][cc]*. It's a great read and full of practical advice about creating well-designed, maintainable applications that empower users. The book is long but justifies its length by sharing good ideas on every page. Due to the length, I let Siri read a lot of book. The screen reader feature on iOS is a godsend. Not only does it read faster than I can in my head, it also never gets distracted or varies the pace leading to a far more efficient read than I would have had otherwise. The only downside of using the screen reader is that it's easier to get distracted and stop paying attention. To anyone considering reading *Code Complete 2* it is worth your time.

With the arrival of March, it's time to bring on a new challenge. This month I want to push forward on a personal project each day. The goal is to set aside some time each day to work on a personal project each day. I spent the first day assessing the current status of the project and setting a few intentions for the challenge. It'd be great if the outcome of the month is a deployed web app. The ultimate goal of the challenge is to build up the habit of working on a personal project each day. A little progress is better than no progress.

## On the Next...

This week I'm going to start in on some readings that I added to my reading list from recommendations in *Code Complete 2*. The first book on my list is *[Programming on Purpose: Essays on Software Design][pop]* by P.J. Plauger. The book, originally released in 1993, received extremely glowing remarks in *Code Complete 2*. It's old, but I'm excited to get some of its wisdom.
