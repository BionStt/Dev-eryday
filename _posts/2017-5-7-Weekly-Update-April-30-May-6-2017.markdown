This week I started working through online programming challenges on [leetcode][lc]. It's been an enjoyable challenge so far. There are so many problems out there to solve. It's incredible just how many online tools are out there to improve at solving programming problems. [HackerRank][rank], the online [UVa Judge][uva], and leetcode all offer similar tools to work through programming challenges. For more of a mathematical point of view there is the classic [Project Euler][euler]. There is definitely no shortage of problems to sate even the most prolific problem solver.

I took a little bit of a breather on Pluralsight courses this week. Sure I continued to watch a little bit each day, but didn't push hard through any of the courses I was viewing. So no courses completed this week. However, I did spend a good amount of time reviewing material from courses I've taken previously. It was nice to review some of the material.

On the MOOC side, I went back to edX's [Sabermetrics 101][saber] course and it's amazing. Sabermetrics is the intersection of three of my favorite subjects: software, math, and baseball. I registered to take the course back in 2014 and never finished. I'm glad I didn't work through it then because I get to enjoy it now! The course offers introductions to SQL, R, applied data science (baseball), and statistics. None of the material is completely new to me, but the blending of all of them together is like a dream come true.
