It's been another busy week. I started reading *[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software][code]*. It's great so far. The book builds up the big ideas of computing and codes all the way from braille and binary to electronics to processors to operating systems to graphical interfaces. It's a high level overview of these concepts, but it is an extremely enjoyable read so far.

From a course standpoint, I finished up [Play by Play: JavaScript Security][jss]. It's a quick look at some ways that developers can better ensure security when writing JavaScript. There were several tips I enjoyed from the course. The first was [oidc-client-js][oidc], a library created by the people who created IdentityServer. oidc-client is a JS library that provides OpenID Connect and OAuth2 support in the browser. Next is [sonarwhal][son] which is a linting tool for improving your site's security, speed, and accessibility. Lastly, there is the [OWASP Top Ten Project][owa], a top ten list of the most critical web application security risks. These resources make the course worthwhile.

## Finished

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Play by Play: JavaScript Security][jss]

## Currents

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [React 16 - The Complete Guide][re], [Getting Started with Visual Studio Team Services (2018)][vsts]

**Book(s):** *[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]*, *[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software][code]*

## On the Next...

I'm looking forward to continuing through [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software][code]* this week. I'm about halfway through the book now. It's going to be fun to continue to build up the computing model. 

Beyond reading, I want to make more of an effort to write code outside of work this week. For the last few weeks I've struggled to find time to write code on personal projects. Sometimes it's easier to write code with no end in mind on sites like [CodeFights][cf] than it is to write code towards actual projects.
