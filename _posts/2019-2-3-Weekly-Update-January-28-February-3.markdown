This week I continued working through [CSS - The Complete Guide (incl. Flexbox, Grid & Sass)][css] in my spare time. It was a great week to stay inside and play with stylesheets. Prior to this course, I've mostly Googled my way through basic styles and leveraged libraries like Bootstrap, never taking the time to actually learn CSS. Every year I tell myself I'm going to actually get comfortable with CSS. This time it's happening. The course content is good. It covers the most important properties and presents plenty of changes to practice the concepts covered. I'm about a third of the way through now.

I read *[The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon][amaz]*. It's an in depth look at how Jeff Bezos and the people around him built Amazon. It's amazing how ambitious Bezos has been in building Amazon and consequently becoming the richest man in the world. Bezos, driven since childhood, has always been able to find a way to see his goals through. The road hasn't always been easy, but Amazon has also always found a way to meet its goals. Exceptional people who are exceptionally driven have no limits.
