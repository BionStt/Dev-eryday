At the start of the week I didn't feel like jumping directly into the [MobileFlashcards][mf] application. So rather than getting back into the swing of the project, I rewatched all of the course content from the [React Nanodegree's][rnd] React Native section. It was nice going back over all of the material. Going over the material for a second time was helpful to gain a deeper understanding. The videos over styling were especially strong. React Native's specific flavor of Flexbox is full of little details that require deeper review.

Once the course review was complete, it was time to get back into the MobileFlashcards project. All the review helped out and made progressing on the project a lot quicker. One thing that made an impact was knowing what was needed for the project while watching the course material. Anytime I saw something that would be useful within the project I made a little note. Beyond that, the React Native workflow is pretty cool. I have development environments set up in both macOS and Windows. My macOS environment has an iOS emulator and the Windows one relies on an Android emulator. It's nice to have both platforms covered.

On the Next...
--------
This week I'm going to continue moving forward with the Mobile Flashcards application. Prior to now it's been pretty slow going so far. The momentum from the end of last week will carry the project through. I'm not sure if I'll finish it this week, but I'm going to work hard and see if I can.

On top of the progress with the Mobile Flashcards app, I'd really like to knockout another book this week. I'm thinking I'll focus my reading time on finishing *Clean Architecture*. The book is probably the most entertaining technically focused book I've picked up this year, and it's full of knowledge that can directly benefit real world software. Hopefully by the time I've finished it, a little bit of the book's wisdom will have rubbed off on me.
