I spent a good amount of time playing with Google's [Firebase][fb] cloud development platform. I have to admit, I really enjoyed it. Deploying a React application with Firebase was dead simple and it's got me thinking about what else I can get online. Up to this point, I've primarily used Microsoft [Azure][az] for my infrastructure solutions. It's been a top-notch service provider so far, but I wanted to check out what it was like on the other side of the fence. After using Firebase to deploy sites, I'm thinking I'll dive into its [Authentication][auth] solution next.

From a course standpoint I finished [Getting Started with Visual Studio Team Services (2018)][vsts]. It's a good overview of how development teams can use [Visual Studio Team Services][team] to deliver high-quality software. As a heavy user of Visual Studio Team Services for source control, I was familiar with a lot of the content. I specifically enjoyed the coverage over managing a project with the toolset. The section showed how to plan out a sprint through creating and assigning work items.

## Finished

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Getting Started with Visual Studio Team Services (2018)][vsts]

**Book(s):** *[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software][code]*

## Currents

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [React 16 - The Complete Guide][re], [Play by Play: Visual Studio Code Can Do That][vsc]

**Book(s):** *[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]*, *[Snowcrash][snow]*

## On the Next...

I will finish up the [Play by Play: Visual Studio Code Can Do That][vsc] for sure this week. It's a short course showcasing the many things that [Visual Studio Code][vscode] can do. Every since the first time I tried VS Code it's been my text editor of choice. I doubt this course will lead to any revelations, but it may lead me down some interesting paths in customizing my text editor. The Quiet Light theme is my favorite right now, but I may have to try out a few and see what's out there.

Beyond the course on Visual Studio Code, I'm going to keep working on the IdeaListz application. I took the last couple of weeks off from working on it and I'm looking forward to diving back into it. I was planning to combine ASP.NET Core Identity and IdentityServer4 as the authentication solution for the site, but now I'm thinking I'll use Firebase Authentication. Hopefully I'll have a working auth prototype before the week is over.
