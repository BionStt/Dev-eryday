The  [SignalR and React Chat App][src] I've been working on is now live and available for chatting. It's basic, but it's really cool. I was able to combine an ASP.NET Core API, SignalR, React, and Redux to make a functional chat application. The source code is on GitHub and can be found [here][ncp]. There are a few things I'd like to add to the application, so I'll probably continue working on it for a little while. I'm also planning to do a write up about the technologies involved, how it works, and what could be added next. Try it out if you get a chance. Feel free to send me a message or two over there.

It was another good week for reading. I powered right through *[Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Planet][seal]* by Jesse Itzler. It's about the month that Itzler invited a Navy SEAL, [David Goggins][dg], to come live with him. It was quite a month. For the month, Itzler agreed to doing whatever Goggins told him to do. This usually included running six miles each morning, four at night, and hundreds of push ups. It was interesting to read about Itzler's growth through the month and the challenges he went through. Itzler pushed through the difficult workouts to get out of his comfort zone. We don't all have to invite a SEAL to live with us, but we can can stand to add a little discomfort to our lives.
