This was a bit of a slow week from a creation standpoint. I still managed to finish up week five of the Machine Learning course. It covered more topics related to learning with neural nets. The homework was to implement a neural net using backpropagation. I spent a lot of time reading this week. *Tools of Titans* has been completed. The book is absolutely loaded with great ideas from some of the best thinkers of our time. I will definitely be learning and applying its lessons for the rest of my life.

Beyond continuing the two Pluralsight courses I'm currently working through, I started implementing a workout tracking feature on [SimpleHealthTracking][sh].
