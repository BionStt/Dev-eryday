I've officially made it through the first two weeks of the [Machine Learning][ML] on Coursera. It's been a lot of fun. Here are some notes over the material.

Week One
--------
**What is Machine Learning:** The modern, formal definition of Machine Learning is "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." This definition comes from [Tom Mitchell][tm], who is the chair of the Machine Learning department at Carnegie Mellon University.

There are two main types of Machine Learning, *supervised learning*, when we have data and know the results already, and *unsupervised learning*, when we don't much at all and build up from there. Furthermore, the supervised learning and unsupervised learning are broken down even further into the types of problems they solve.
