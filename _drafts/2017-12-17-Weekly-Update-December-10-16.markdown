Wow, just a couple more weeks left and the year is over. I had another good week. My main focus this week was the Five Languages in Five Weeks challenge. I finished up week two, covering [Elixir][exend], and started up week three, covering [Haskell][hsstart]. Learning Elixir was a lot of fun and getting started with Haskell has been enjoyable too. The challenge is going pretty well so far.

Finished
--------
**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Play by Play: Problem Solving in a Developer World][ps], [Getting Started with Elixir][expl]

**Book(s):** *[The Startup Way][tsw]*

Currents
--------
**Pluralsight Course(s):**  [Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect][secure], [Haskell Fundamentals Part 1][hf]

**Book(s):** *[Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns][sbp]*, *[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!][lh]*, *[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!][fen]*

On the Next...
--------
I'm going to move forward with Haskell and finish up week three on Thursday. I want to see how far I can get in *[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!]*. The book is a creative introduction to the language and its light style reminds me of *[The Little Schemer][tls]*.

On Friday the challenge will enter week four. I'll start learning [Go][g] at that point. It'll be nice to get back into a more standard programming language. It should be a more comfortable experience than either Elixir or Haskell.
