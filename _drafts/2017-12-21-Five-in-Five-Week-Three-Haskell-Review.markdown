[Haskell][hs] is the perfect language for the [Five Languages in Five Weeks][fnf] challenge. It's different, has a lot of interesting features, and is a actually used by quite a few people.

### Further Learning Plans


### Resources
I was able to pull from a couple of resources to learn Haskell this week.

[Haskell Fundamentals Part 1][hsp] a Pluralsight course by Benson Joeris. This course was solid. Joeris quickly runs down the language features.  
*[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!][lgg]* by Miran Lipovaca. This is the go to resource for anyone learning Haskell. I've enjoyed working through it so far. I got through the first seven chapters.  
[REST API in Haskell][re] this is an awesome blog post where the author sets up a REST API using Haskell. I didn't implement it myself but greatly enjoyed reading over it.
