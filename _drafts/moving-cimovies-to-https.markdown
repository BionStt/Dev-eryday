Back in the winter of 2014, I made a website called centralillinoismovies.info. It was pretty much a basic movie blog. It was developed in ASP.NET MVC and the site hasn't been updated for a really long time. The goal was to create as much content as possible and get a little bit of advertisement money. Well, it's been over three years since the site went live and I've got $3.00 from the ads. There was just not much demand for the site and I wasn't willing to put in the effort required to create the content that it would take to make the site a success. So I got to thinking, "What could I do to make this site worth keeping around?" Getting back into content generation isn't the answer. Using it as an opportunity to do a major refactoring exercise could be an option but there are better ways to do that. Then it hit me, I should use it as a test to make the site HTTPS compliant.

Lately I completed watching the a Pluralsight course, [Things Every Developer Must Know About HTTPS][https], by Troy Hunt. The course talks about the many benefits of HTTPS and how to make your sites support HTTPS.
