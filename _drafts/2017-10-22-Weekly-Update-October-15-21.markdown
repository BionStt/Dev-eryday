At the start of the week I didn't feel like jumping directly into the [MobileFlashcards][mf] application. So rather than getting back into the swing of the project, I rewatched all of the course content from the [React Nanodegree's][rnd] React Native section. It was nice going back over all of the material. Going over the material for a second time was really helful. The videos over styling were especially strong. React Native's specific flavor of Flexbox is full of little details that require deeper review.
