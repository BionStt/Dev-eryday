Every so often I imagine the possibilities of Dev-eryday. Often the possibilities will come in the form of challenges. One of the ones I like is an ambitious project where I would log the process of going from tens of views a week to thousands a day. I would show the current traffic reports, lay out a plan to improve the numbers, put it in place, and give updates all along the way. At the end of the day, I don't really care about how many views the site gets, just that I keep myself improving every single. Sure, it would be nice to get some views, but the content I'm producing now isn't really deserving of widespread appeal. It does a good job of logging what I'm doing to improve on a personal level, but it doesn't provide others with any value. If I were to take this project on, the first step would be to create more valuable content.

On the course front, I completed [Encapsulation and SOLID][sol]. It's got some good material and gives a thorough overview of implement SOLID code. Encapsulation and SOLID gives introduces each of the SOLID principles and shows how to refactor towards a software design that falls in line with them. While we're on the subject of SOLID, everytime I look at anything that discusses SOLID I'm reminded of the great book, *[Adaptive Code via C#: Agile Coding with Design Patterns and SOLID Principles][acc], by Gary McLean Hall. I couldn't recommend it more. I wasn't aware a second edition came out either, I'm glad I looked it up. Pair the course with the book and you've got many hours of learning ahead.

## Finished

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Encapsulation and SOLID][sol]

## Currents

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [React 16 - The Complete Guide][re], [Building Business Applications with Angular and ASP.NET Core][bba]

**Book(s):** *[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]*

## On the Next...

I'm going to really start getting in to *[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]* this week. I took a little break from reading so I need to make up for lost time. I'm going to record some notes for the book here on Dev-eryday as I complete the sections of the book. The first section covers the foundations of continuous delivery. So look forward to a summary going over stuff like configuration management, continuous integration, and testing strategy at some point this week.
