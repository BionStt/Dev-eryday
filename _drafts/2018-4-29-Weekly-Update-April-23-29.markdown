Every so often I imagine the possibilities of Dev-eryday. Often the possibilities will come in the form of challenges. One of the ones I like is an ambitious project where I would log the process of going from tens of views a week to thousands a day. I would show the current traffic reports, lay out a plan to improve the numbers, put it in place, and give updates all along the way. At the end of the day, I don't really care about how many views the site gets, just that I keep myself improving every single. Sure, it would be nice to get some views, but the content I'm producing now isn't really deserving of widespread appeal. It does a good job of logging what I'm doing to improve on a personal level, but it doesn't provide others with any value. If I were to take this project on, the first step would be to create more valuable content.
