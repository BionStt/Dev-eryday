I started a new challenge this week. The challenge is [Five Languages in Five Weeks][fnf] and consists of spending the next five weeks trying to learn a different programming language each week. It's going to be a fun ride. For the first week I'm learning [TypeScript][ts]. It's going well so far. 

Since I've been preparing for and taking part in the Five Languages in Five Weeks challenge, I wasn't able to finish any books for courses this week. So this week is pretty light on completing material. I will probably finish less content over the next five weeks while focused on learning languages.

Finished
--------
**Pluralsight Course(s):** none

**Book(s):** none

Currents
--------
**Pluralsight Course(s):**  [Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect][secure], [Getting Started with TypeScript][tss], [TypeScript In-depth][tsi]

**Book(s):** *[Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns][sbp]*, *[Tao of Seneca: Volume 3][tao]*

On the Next...
--------
I'm going to continue learning TypeScript through Thursday. I will definitely finish at least the [Getting Started with TypeScript][tss] course on Pluralsight. I'm halfway through the course right now and it's quite good. The course will quickly get anyone familiar with JavaScript up to speed on the basics of TypeScript very quickly.

Once I'm done with my week with TypeScript, I will move on to [Elixir][ex] on Friday. I've attempted to learn Elixir a couple of times already, but I've been unable to sustain any kind of momentum with it. I'm hoping that the style of focusing only on Elixir will allow me to dig in further than I ever have before. I'm pretty excited for this chance to come at Elixir again at the end of this week.
