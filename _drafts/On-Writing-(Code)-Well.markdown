Programming is writing. Even though the code we write is processed by computers that are indifferent to our style, it's essential to take care special care to write clearly and concisely. Lately I've been looking into ways to improve my natural language writing. In this venture, I've read both *[The Elements of Style][style]* by William Strunk and E.B. White, and *[On Writing Well][oww]* by William Zinsser. It's amazing how much of the advice from Strunk, White, and Zinsser applied not only to writing, but also to programming.
