The first month of dev-eryday 2017 is now complete! It's been a lot of fun so far and this week was another leap forward. I'm really enjoying working through Cory House's Pluralsight courses on React. I can't wait to start using React in production, I might even have to start playing with React Native.

I successfully completed the fourth week of the Machine Learning course. This week Neural Nets were introduced. We used the neural nets in conjunction with logistic regression to classify handwritten numbers as what number they actually are.

This week I plan to finish the class on React and Redux and the C# Language Internals course. When those are complete I want to look into using [Web API with .NET Core][core]. I started reviewing *[Algorithm Design Manual]* to refresh my mind on some algorithms techniques.
