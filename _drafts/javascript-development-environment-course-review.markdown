For the last week I've been taking the course, ["Building a JavaScript Development Environment"][bjde], on PluralSight. The course is led by Cory House and covers how to build a modern JavaScript development environment using many of the most popular and powerful tools available to web developers today. The course is a perfect survey of how to approach JavaScript development right now. The rational behind which tools are used is presented in a clear, and thorough manner. Alternative options are cited showing just how many choices exist in JavaScript-land. With the pace at which JavaScript moves, I'm sure some of these tools will be replaced with better options at some point in the near future, but this material is perfect for anyone wanting to kickstart their JavaScript development skills.

The key focus of the course is to create a robust development environment that utilizes the best tools available to developers. Through leveraging these tools, software developers and their teams can improve the quality of their code and the deliverables being created.


As a developer who has primarily built projects for the web using MVC frameworks, the JavaScript development is a complex beast. There are so many decisions to be made when rolling your own project template.
