When I woke up this morning, I had 41 tabs open in Chrome on my cell phone. I then sat down at my desktop and saw 40+ more tabs strung out accross three different instances of Chrome. This is just too many tabs! There's no way I'm going to go back and read or even look at all of these pages again. So I cleaned them all up. On my phone I bookmarked all the tabs that had anything I was marginally interested in and I just closed out of Chrome on the browser. Keeping excess tabs active or discarded downloads around builds up over time. Here's a few steps to take to minimize some of the extra noise generated from digital waste.

Moving towards digital minimalism can help to tidy up your work environment. With less overhead around to distract you, you can focus on the more important stuff.
