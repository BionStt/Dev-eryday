When I look for software development books to read, I typically look for books recommended by software developers who I look up to. That's exactly how I came to find *[Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns][sbp]* by Kent Beck. I was reading through a bunch of [signalvnoise][svn] posts and came across a post by [dhh][dhh] recommending [five programming books][dhhbooks]. The first book that dhh mentions is *Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns* and I'm thankful for the recommendation. I've never touched the Smalltalk language, or ever really considered it, but I thought that if dhh holds the book in high-esteem it is more than likely something worth checking out. I'll probably get through the other four books at some point, but for now let's get into some of the key ideas from *Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns*. Note that this isn't an exhaustive summary of all of the book's content. For more great content, pick up the book.

Tips for Approaching the Material
--------
Learn a little bit of the Smalltalk syntax. Many of the code samples throughout the book are clear and readable with only the most basic knowledge of the language's syntax. Here is the [syntax] definitions I used to pick up enough to get of an overview.

^ - function return value
