Another great week for reading. For as long as I can remember, whenever I've seen the name [John Carmack][jc] pop up I've took note. You see, John Carmack is one of the greatest software developers who have ever lived. *[Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture][doom]* features both John Carmack and another talented developer named [John Romero][jr]. The two Johns created video games and changed the world in the process. The book details their devotion to their craft and provides an inside look at the dynamics within the company. The book is a solid read for anyone remotely interested video games or software development in general.
