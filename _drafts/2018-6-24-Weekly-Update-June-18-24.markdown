Another great week for reading. For as long as I can remember, whenever I've seen the name [John Carmack][jc] pop up I've took note. You see, John Carmack is one of the greatest software developers who have ever lived. *[Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture][doom]* features both John Carmack and another talented developer named [John Romero][jr]. The two Johns created video games and changed the world in the process. The book details their devotion to their craft and provides an inside look at the dynamics within the company. The book is a solid read for anyone remotely interested video games or software development in general.

I completed two courses on Pluralsight this week. The first was [Docker Deep Dive][doc] which is a nice healthy dose of Docker. There's a ton of great information in the course. One thing that the course did really well was informing viewers details on the inner workings of the Docker Architecture. Some of the information might not be directly utilized when using containers, but is interesting and helpful to know. The other course was about creating [ASP.NET Core APIs that use IdentityServer4][api]. It's a quick course where a developer walks through a production API he created for a payment processing service. While presenting the code, best practices for working with APIs are discussed.

## Finished

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Docker Deep Dive][doc], [Play by Play - Creating APIs for Developers with Identity Server 4][api]

**Book(s):** *[Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture][doom]*

## Currents

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [React 16 - The Complete Guide][re], 

**Book(s):** *[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]*

## On the Next...

Each day of this month, I've spent some time on [freeCodeCamp][fcc] solving challenges. I'm a professional software developer, but I wanted to go through the exercises and see both how far I could get and how much I could learn in a month's time. So far it's been a nice experience. I would say in terms of learning for a professional dev the challenges won't provide much of a challenge, but the information content is great. I'm going to continue completing at least a few challenges each day and see where I'm at when the week ends.
