I did a little exploratory learning this week in the form of learning about Google's [Flutter][fl]. With [Flutter: Getting Started][flu] being released on Pluralsight, it felt like a good time to check out what all the fuss about the SDK is. Flutter is interesting because it allows developers to create native mobile apps for both Android and iOS with one codebase using the Dart programming language. Yes, lots of other SDKs like [React Native][rn] and [Xamarin][xm] already exist and do similar things, but it's fun to gain a little insight on how the new options are doing things. Right now, I'm intrigued by Flutter but not keen on using Dart, which reminds me a lot of TypeScript, when I could be using JavaScript, TypeScript, or C# to build apps. I'm going to keep my eyes on Flutter but probably won't dive in just yet.
