This week I started digging deeper into what exactly is going on with the Blockchain. I've always been interested in it but never felt like actually going further than the wikipedia page and a couple of whitepages. Sure, I've monitored Bitcoin prices for years, wishing I had invested when I first heard about them, but the subject has never been more than a curiosity. Now, with the way Bitcoin and Ethereum are growing, the potential of blockchain systems is impossible to ignore. There are two sources I've used to get started learning about the space:
  1. [The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency - Nick Szabo][pod] - This is a podcast where Nick Szabo, Naval Ravikant, and Tim Ferriss discuss what crytocurrency is and how it is going to take over the banking industry. The podcast is a perfect place to start.
  
  2. [Blockchain Fundamentals][block] - Blockchain Fundaments is a course that was added to Pluralsight this week that is led by Jan-Erik Sandberg. The course offers a background on what the blockchain is, how it can be used, how to use it in development, and how to use it moving forward.
