Released in 2010, Jez Humble and Dave Farley's *[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]* has become the go to resource for teaching software developers about deploying software. The book aims to teach readers best practices on how to release software as quickly and as safely as possible. The most successful technique that the authors have found is through the use of continuous delivery.

Since I'm reading this book, I want to take the time to record some thorough notes so I can come back to them later. It'd also be nice if they helped anyone else gain knowledge too. Therefore, I'm going to record my notes here at Dev-eryday through a series of posts. There will be three total posts, one covering each section from the book. This post covers Part I, Foundations. I'm also considering doing some videos on YouTube where I go over the notes covering a couple of chapters at a time. I think that would be a fun little experiment.

Part I: Foundations

Chapter 1: The Problem of Delivering Software

Chapter 2: Configuration Management

Chapter 3: Continuous Integration

Chapter 4: Implementing a Testing Strategy

Stay tuned for part 2, The Deployment Pipeline.
