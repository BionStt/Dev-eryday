So many tech books to read, so little time. There's a major power in reading books. Books go to depths that can't be matched in other sources like videos and blog posts. Books can pierce all the way down to the root of a subject. I have a long list of books I want to read or re-read at all times. Here's a sampling of the ten software development books that I'd like to complete in 2018. Note that this list is subject to change.

1. Working Effectively with Legacy Code - I'm currently reading this book right now. It's great so far.
2. Refactoring - I've read parts of *Refactoring* before. I would like to dig deep into and take what I can from it.
3. Domain Driven Design - I tried to read *Domain Driven Design* last summer and couldn't get into it. I didn't read more than the first chapter, so I didn't give it a fair shake. This time I'll get further into it.
4. Dependency Injection in .NET - This is another book I'm familiar with. I actually think that I read the whole book back in 2013. I probably wasn't read to get the book's full effect, but I am now so it's time to revisit it.
5. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture - This is a book that was recommended by dhh, so I have to read it. It's a book that's mostly about patterns.
6. CLR via C# - This is a deep cut into how the Common Language Runtime works. If I want to be great with .NET, I might as well go through the classics.
7. C# in Depth - There's a new edition of *C# in Depth* coming out later this year. I can't wait to get my hands on it and read it.
8. Python Machine Learning - I bought this book during Packt's $5.00 sale over the holidays. I want to get into it and pick up some deep Machine Learning skills.
9. Introduction to Algorithms - It's always a good time to review algorithms.
10. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming - Someday I will finish SICP. Hopefully this year.
