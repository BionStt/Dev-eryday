It's been a great week. I made a lot of progress on the [MobileFlashcards][mf] application. Only a few more features to go and the project will be complete. Developing for mobile has been a lot of fun. The coolest thing for me is running the in-development app on my laptop and accessing via Expo over the local network on my Android device. That is such an awesome feature and allows me to test on both iOS and Android very easily. It's also amazing how quickly you can go from idea to implementation in React Native. The environment lends itself well to rapid development. My guess is that it gets tricky to use with complex apps but basic CRUD type features are a joy to build.
