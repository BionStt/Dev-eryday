It's always nice to read something that can empower you. This week I couldn't put down *[Getting Real][real]* by 37Signals. The book focuses on how to build, launch, maintain, and grow a lean web application. Everything the author's preach is practical and can be used to create a better product. For anyone interested in delivering small, usable applications, *Getting Real* is a tome. In addition to *Getting Real*, the author's have also written two other books: *[Rework][work]* and *[Remote: Office Not Required][mote]*. I haven't read *Remote* yet, but I can also strongly recommend *Rework*. There's a reason why [Basecamp][base] has been such a successful product, these books provide actionable advice that can be applied in the real world.

This week I dove head first into the development of IdeaListz. I'm working on the React components first. It's been a lot of fun working to create the components and putting them together to form the molecules that will drive the entire application. It's always enjoyable to start a new project like this. Those first couple of days of working are filled with so much uncertainty due to all of the problems that need to be solved. It's going to be a challenge to get the application online but I'm looking forward to it.

On the Next...
--------
With all the React development I've been doing, I've been learning more about the environment each day. All of the Pluralsight courses I've been watching about React have been good, but I've been wanting to go through an indepth book on the subject. This week I was reading some of Facebook's documentation for create-react-app and stumbled upon *[Fullstack React: The Complete Guide to ReactJS and Friends][rjs]*. I'm not too far into the book yet, but the if there is truth in advertising it is bound to be a winner. I hope to get deep into the heart of the content in the week ahead. Anything I pick up will be applied to IdeaListz. It's going to be another great week.
