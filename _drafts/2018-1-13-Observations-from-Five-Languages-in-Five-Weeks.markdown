 The [Five Languages in Five Weeks][fnf] was an incredible challenge. I’m glad that I went through it, it was a perfect way to close out the first year of Dev-eryDay. In spending time with a new language each week, I learned a lot about programming languages and getting up to speed quickly with different workflows. 

1. **One Week Isn’t Enough** - A week isn’t enough time to learn a programming language. I knew this coming in but it really became apparent in during the challenge. One week is long enough to get a feel for a language though. You can pick up the syntax, get an idea of the community, and find out where the language is well suited.
2. **TypeScript > JavaScript** - TypeScript is a huge improvement on JavaScript. Bolting on additional features to JavaScript, like types, makes it a more robust and usable language. At this point, if I were to develop any large scale system using script, I would pick TypeScript.
3. **Need More Time with Elixir** - I’ve been wanting to learn Elixir for over a year but never invested the time required. The week I spent was enough to build my interest in the language again. I will carve out some time this year to dig in.
4. **Not Feeling Haskell** - Haskell is interesting, but it’s not for me right now. I think if I had unlimited time to learn about everything in the world, I'd definitely put some quality time with Haskell, but I can't see spending any more on it in the near future. Elixir offers a lot of the same benefits with a gentler environment.
5. **Go Is Interesting** - Go was really cool. I like how simple the language is with a small number of keywords.
6. **Swift Feels Like an Old Friend** - I only had to spend a few days with Swift before it felt like an old friend. Its features are at once familiar but at the same time unique. The toolset is really cool too. Having Playgrounds on both the iPad and within Xcode is a nice option when learning the language. I greatly enjoyed my time with Swift.
7. **Visual Studio Code is Awesome** - Outside of Swift, I used Visual Studio Code to write code for each of the languages. VS Code is a fantastic text editor and something I would miss if it weren’t around.
8. **Brew Saves the Day** - Brew was huge in setting up three of the five languages on my development PC. Thank you, Brew.
9. **C# Is a Really Good Language** - In getting up to speed with each of these five languages I really came to appreciate the design of C#. C# as a language provides pretty much any feature I could ever want. It has amazing support for object orientation and is becoming more functional with each release. I may not write C# code forever, but I will always enjoy using it.
10. **Learning New Languages is Fun** - It’s a lot of fun to learn new languages. Even if you have no need to learn a specific language, it’s good practice to learn a new language.
