Getting a new PC is often a bit of a challenge. From getting all the software you're accustomed to, to getting all your files in the right place, setting up the new machine is a time consuming process. Taking that a step further, I recently switched to a new operating system for development (Ubuntu) and have also been playing with MacOS. I've been familiar with linux for years, but this is really the first time I've used MacOS for any considerable amount of time.

Why Switch?

I'm not unhappy with Windows. I'm still using it a ton and its future looks as bright as every with all the cool hardware coming out of the Surface lines and other third party manufacturers. Part of the philosophy of dev-eryday is to try new things, and getting out of my development environment comfort zone is a great opportunity to push growth. Having high-level abilities with multiple operating systems opens up possibilities to take advantage of tools that are better in a different environment.
