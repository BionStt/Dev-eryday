In all my time working with .NET, I've never played with the [SignalR][snr] or [ASP.NET Core SignalR][src]. That all changed this week when I worked through [Getting Started with ASP.NET Core SignalR][sig]. The course provides a very basic look into how SignalR can be used to bring real-time functionality to your projects. Clients can connect to the server via transports, typically through [WebSockets][ws], and then communicate through the hub, the name of the connection between the client and the server. The demo app created in the course features an online storefront where users can order coffee and then get real-time status updates as their beverage is prepared. I'm itching to use that course as a launching point to create a basic chatroom. Once the basic chatroom is created it could be improved with React. That could be a fun tutorial series.
