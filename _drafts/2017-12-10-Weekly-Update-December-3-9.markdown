The first week of [Five Languages in Five Weeks][fnf] is in the books. My week with [TypeScript][ts] was a lot of fun.

Finished
--------
**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Getting Started with TypeScript][tss], [TypeScript In-depth][tsi]

**Book(s):** *[Tao of Seneca: Volume 3][tao]*

Currents
--------
**Pluralsight Course(s):**  [Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect][secure], 

**Book(s):** *[Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns][sbp]*, 

On the Next...
--------
I'm going to continue working with [Elixir][ex] until Thursday. At that point I will start working with [Haskell][hs]. Haskell is an exciting language because I'm a little scared by it. I haven't even looked at the syntax yet, but I know that it's supposed to be quite a bit different than most programming languages. I think that's a great thing. Yes, it's going to be uncomfortable, but that's what makes it exciting. As long as I get a "Hello World" program written for it and learn some of the basics I'll consider my week with Haskell a success.
