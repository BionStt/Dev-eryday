It's great how the summer holidays (Memorial Day, Independance Day, Labor Day), play out like a trilogy each year. Memorial Day is the start and sets the tone of what's to come. Independace Day in the middle acts as a bridge between the start and end of the season. Labor Day is the finish line marking the end of summer and the beginning of fall. With Memorial Day happening this week, it was the perfect week to set some goals for summer 2017. Make it a great one.
