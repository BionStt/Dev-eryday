It's great how the summer holidays (Memorial Day, Independance Day, Labor Day), play out like a trilogy each year. Memorial Day is the start and sets the tone for what's to come. Independace Day in the middle acts as a bridge between the start and end of the season. Labor Day is the finish line marking the end of summer and the beginning of fall. With Memorial Day happening this week, it was the perfect week to set some goals for summer 2017. My goal for the summer is to continue to get better. I want to push myself to write my best code, have my best ideas, feel great, and to move forward with everything I can. So here's summer 2017, make it a great one.

[GitHub][gh] may get a lot of the press and be the cool kid in town, and deservedly so, it's an amazing tool and community, but [Visual Studio Team Services][vsts](VSTS) offers a compelling alternative. In the past, I used Microsoft's cloud source control solution but hadn't worked with it much since I've been using GitHub for the last eight months. Things have came a long way in eight short months. This week I got back into using VSTS and it was absolutely great. VSTS has everything I want as a developer: work planning tools, git, continuous integration, package management, release management, and testing. The best part is that it offers free private repos. Sometimes code doesn't need (deserve) to be published on GitHub, that's a perfect opportunity to test VSTS out.
