The week started off pretty slow and I didn't get started on the React Native project until the weekend. The majority of the progress early in the week was from reading. The book I'm really focusing on right now is called *[Principles][pri]*. It's written by Ray Dalio and it presents the principles that Dalio has used to become one of the world's most successful investors. Dalio is a deep, and logical thinking and his principles can be applied to both life and business. Beyond *Principles*, I rushed through *[Grokking Algorithms][grok]* one afternoon. The book is a fun look at a lot of algorithms. I recommend it for anyone already familiar with the content who is looking for a refresher on algorithms.
