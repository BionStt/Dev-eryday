It's good to start every year with a few goals in mind. Without having a target, there's nothing to aim for. With nothing to aim for it's hard to make trackable progress on anything. This list of goals is a stream of consciousness of the development goals I'm aiming for in 2019 right now. Note that everything here is subject to change, but I can see a lot of these taking priority in the year ahead. Over the next few weeks, I'm going to put together a plan to make these things happen. Here's what I'm aiming to make happen in 2019.

Launch Three New Apps or Sites - Launch at least three new sites or apps. In order to keep pace, plan to get something launched every three months in order to stay ahead of schedule.

Read More than Ten Software Development Books - In a perfect world, I'd complete one technical development book each month. Often development books take longer to read than a single month, therefore the baseline goal is ten book. Make it happen.

Interview with Several Companies - Interviewing is a great way to assess your current skills. It makes it apparent what you're good at and what you still need to learn. Put yourself out there and go on a number of interviews. See if there is a good fit out there that works for both sides.

Find Joy in Development - Bring joy into the practice of development. The majority of the time I greatly enjoy writing code, but sometimes development can feel like a chore. Try to bring the beginner's mind back to the practice of development in order to make the act of development more joyful.

Keep Learning Daily - Keep learning every day. The goal of dev-eryday is to get better as a software developer every day. Keep living out the mission of the site.

Write Over Ten Development Posts on Dev-eryday - I didn't post too much in depth technical articles here in 2018. That's disappointing to me. I want to raise the bar in 2019. Post not only more in depth technical articles, but improve upon the quality. Write valuable posts that share useful information that people want to return to.

Connect with Industry Experts - There are so many great industry experts out there. Connect with a few. Try to provide as much value to them as they provide to you.

Teach Others Valuable Skills - Teach others lessons that you've already learned. Share the information you find useful. Publish information here on the site and also help teach in person when opportunities arise.

Use Skills for Creating a Better World - Try to build software and generate work that helps make the world a better place.

So these are the things that I'm aiming to make happen in 2019. Nothing here feels out of reach. Yes, it will take a lot of hard work and dedication, but I know that I can accomplish each item I've listed here. We'll see what the future holds.
