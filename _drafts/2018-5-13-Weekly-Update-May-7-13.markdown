It's been another busy week. I started reading *[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software][code]*. It's great so far. The book builds up the big ideas of computing all the way from braille and binary codes to electronics to processors to operating systems to graphical interfaces. It's a very high level overview of these concepts, but it is an extremely enjoyable read so far.

From a course standpoint, I finished up [Play by Play: JavaScript Security][jss]. It's a quick look at some ways that developers can ensure security when write JavaScript. There were a number of tips I enjoyed from the course. 

## Finished

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Play by Play: JavaScript Security][jss]

## Currents

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [React 16 - The Complete Guide][re], [Getting Started with Visual Studio Team Services (2018)][vsts]

**Book(s):** *[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]*, *[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software][code]*

## On the Next...

I'm looking forward to continuing through [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software][code]* this week. I'm about halfway through the book now. It's going to be fun to continue to build up the computing model. The first was [oidc-client-js][oidc]. This is a library created by the people who created IdentityServer. oidc-client is a JS library that provides OpenID Connect and OAuth2 support in the browser. Next is [sonarwhal][son] which is a linting tool for improving your site's security, speed, and accessibility. Lastly, there is the [OWASP Top Ten Project][owa], a top ten list of the most critical web application security risks.
