It's been another busy week. I started reading *[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software][code]*. It's great so far. The book builds up the big ideas of computing all the way from braille and binary codes to electronics to processors to operating systems to graphical interfaces. It's a very high level overview of these concepts, but it is an extremely enjoyable read so far.
