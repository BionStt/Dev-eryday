Back in June, I went through a ton of the challenges on [freeCodeCamp][fcc]. I completed at least one of the challenges each day for the whole month. By the end of the month I had completed 300+ challenges. I would qualify the experience as more fun than it was difficult. This week I went back to the site for the first time since June. While there, I found out I was only two challenges away from earning their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. So, I completed the challenges and now I have the certification. Check it [out][cert]! There are five problems that need to be solved to get the cert. As a seasoned developer with a CS degree, I wouldn't say any of them were hard, but I enjoyed working through them. The [Cash Register][cr] took the longest (about an hour) and was the most enjoyable one to solve. For anyone looking to get into coding or people who just a good place to brush up on their web development skills, I highly recommend freeCodeCamp.

In terms of learning, I took in a lot of great information in the last week. I finished reading *[Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't][gtg]* by Jim Collins. The book, as its title suggests, lays out a number of things that companies can do to go from being a good company to being a great one. My favorite takeaway from the book was the [hedgehog concept][hc]. The idea is that a hedgehog has one tatic which is curling up and taking advantage of its spikey hair to protect itself. Great companies focus on being the best at one thing. I like this concept a lot and it's applicable to individuals as well. It's time to move from good to great.
