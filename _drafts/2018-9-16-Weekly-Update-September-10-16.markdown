Back in June, I went through a ton of the challenges on [freeCodeCamp][fcc]. I completed at least one of the challenges each day for the whole month. By the end of the month I had completed 300+ challenges. I would qualify the experience as more fun than it was difficult. This week I went back to the site for the first time since June. While there, I found out I was only two challenges away from earning their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. So, I completed the challenges and now I have the certification. Check it [out][cert]! There are five problems that need to be solved to get the cert. As a seasoned developer with a CS degree, I wouldn't say any of them were hard, but I enjoyed working through them. The [Cash Register][cr] took the longest (about an hour) and was the most enjoyable one to solve. For anyone looking to get into coding or people who just a good place to brush up on their web development skills, I highly recommend freeCodeCamp.
