I'm thinking about starting to cut back my reading to focus more on technical books for a while. This week I finished *[Apprenticeship Patterns][ap]* and it's got me inspired to step my technical game up. I'm thinking that I'll primarily read technical books for at least a month and then assess from there. I like pulling from a wide variety of books for ideas though, so I probably won't limit the subjects I read about for the long term. For now it's all technical, all the time. It should be a fun experience.

I spent a lot of time on [Quizlet][ql] this week. I've known about the site for a while, but I hadn't really taken advantage of it until now. The site is extremely well made. I made a study deck over some terms related to nuclear reactors for some stuff I'm learning for work and it's really helping me gain an understanding of what I need to know. In fact, this experience has went so well, I think I'll make it a point in future to create decks around anything I want to learn. Making flash cards to learn is like test-driven learning.
