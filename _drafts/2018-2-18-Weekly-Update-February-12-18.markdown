I'm thinking about starting to cut back my reading to focus more on technical books for a while. This week I finished *[Apprenticeship Patterns][ap]* and it's got me inspired to step my technical game up. I'm thinking that I'll primarily read technical books for at least a month and then assess from there. I like pulling from a wide variety of books for ideas so I don't want to limit the subjects I read about in the long term. For now though, it's all technical, all the time. It should be a fun experience.
