[Swift][swi] is a fantastic language. Of all the languages I've attempted to learn in the [Five Languages in Five Weeks][fnf] challenge, Swift is my favorite.

### Swift Features
Swift pulls ideas from a ton of languages. It's [Wikipedia][wiki] page shows that it takes from all of the following: Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, D. With all of these influences, the language feels very natural and robust. Swift is a multi-paradigm language supporting protocol-oriented, object-oriented, and functional programming. 

My favorite part of working with Swift is using the Swift Playground that is built into Xcode. Swift Playground is like a dynamic REPL where you can write Swift and it will be compiled on the fly. It's a really cool tool. The Swift Playground functionality is also available on iPad so it's possible learn Swift on the go.

### Further Learning Plans
If I were to start learning Swift seriously my number one task would be to work through [iOS 11 & Swift 4 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp][ude]. I went through a number of sections of the course and it's extremely well made.

### Resources
I was able to pull from a few resources to learn Swift this week. The learning material built for Swift seems to be exceptional. 

[iOS 11 & Swift 4 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp][ude] by Angela Yu on Udemy. I mentioned this course above. It's a thorough treatment on how to use Swift to develop iOS apps.  
[Swift 3 Fundamentals][sf] by Simon Allardice on Pluralsight. Phenomenal course covering the basics of Swift. I don't think I've ever seen a better introductory course for any programming language.  
*[The Swift Programming Language][spl]* by Apple. Apple's official language documentation. I spent a fair amount of time with the book but primarily drew from the two video courses.

### Quick Final Thoughts
Learning Swift over the last week has been incredible. Apple has produced a high quality programming language and it's clear why developers adopted it so quickly after release. The Swift Playground, exceptional documentation, top notch learning material, and a growing development community are huge in making the language such a joy to use.
