On more than one occasion, I've accidently committed a file to GitHub that I didn't intend to. I should have had these files in the gitignore file before checking in the code but I forgot. Mistakes happen all the time. You can use the process below to remove the unwanted file from the repository when accidently checking in a file that you didn't mean to push.

Left (paper) notes at other location. Will complete when I return.
