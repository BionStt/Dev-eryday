I've been working hard on dev-eryday for over half a year at this point. Dev-eryday is the conscience effort to get better at software development every day. It's a huge committment and has become a huge part of my life this year. Any time you totally commit to something, it's worthwhile to periodically evaluate exactly what it is that you are doing. Consider why you are doing what you're doing. Determine if what you are doing is worth the time invested.
