I've been working hard on dev-eryday for over half a year at this point. Dev-eryday is the conscience effort to get better at software development every day. It's a huge committment and has become a big part of my life this year. Any time you totally commit to something, it's worthwhile to periodically evaluate exactly what it is that you are doing. Consider why you are doing what you're doing. Determine if what you are doing is worth the time invested.

What I am Doing
-------
Getting better each day.
Generating ideas about what I can build and how I can improve.
Creating.

Why I am Doing It

Is It Worth the Time
--------
Yes, completely. This may change as time gets more scarce. Right now learning and creating is worth the I'm investing in it. Considering how a lot of my non-working hours are spent, any time spent on Dev-eryday is time well spent. 

I look at it this way, I can spend my time on an activity that has the chance of paying off or I can spend that time consuming media which has **no** chance of payoff.
