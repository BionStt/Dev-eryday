I've been working hard on dev-eryday for over a year at this point. Dev-eryday is the conscience effort to get better at software development every day. It's a huge committment and has become a big part of my life over the last year. Any time you totally commit to something, it's worthwhile to periodically evaluate exactly what it is that you are doing. Consider why you are doing what you're doing. Determine if what you are doing is worth the time invested.

What I am Doing
-------
Getting better each day.
Generating ideas about what I can build and how I can improve.
Creating software and solving problems at work.

Why I am Doing It
-------
To get better mostly. Every action I take to improve my craft is something that could help me down the road. There's so much potential in everything that we do.

Another big reason that I do this is because it can help others. Ideally, my practice is having a positive effect on others. Just the idea of knowing that others are out there working hard every day makes me want to push myself.

There's also a chance that I can make a little money from creating and release software. There's a lot of luck involved in making it big, but I don't see any reasons why I can't at least double my salary via work on the side. I haven't really been monetarily driven in my my personal projects so far, but it would be nice to start seeing some payoff.

Is It Worth the Time
--------
Yes, completely. This may change as time gets more scarce. Right now learning and creating is worth the I'm investing in it. Considering how a lot of my non-working hours are spent, any time spent on Dev-eryday is time well spent. 

I look at it this way, I can spend my time on an activity that has the chance of paying off or I can spend that time consuming media which has **no** chance of payoff. 

What I Want to do More Of
--------
Releasing my personal projects. Last year I didn't ship any new software in my spare time. I want to change that this year. I want to release at least one product and I'm planning to release a total of three. Sure, three products is ambitious, but I think I can do it. All I have to do is work at it each day. Focus on one project at a time and see how far you can with a few sprints.
