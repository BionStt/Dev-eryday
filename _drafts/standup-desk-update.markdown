It's been a few weeks now since I got my [standup desk][desk]. I can confidently say that the desk is best thing I've purchased this year. I highly recommend anybody who spends a large majority of their working hours at a desk to pick one up if they can.

The first week of having the desk was a major adjustment period. I struggled with some discomfort in my shoulders and neck as my body adjusted to the standing posture. This brief and minor discomfort was worth it. By the second week of using the desk I could easily stand for five hours over the course of the working day and then be able to follow it up with any exercise in the evening.
