It was another good week. I spent a lot of my reading time going through *[Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving][tlp]*. *Think Like a Programmer* is a lot like *[How to Solve It][hsi]*, but instead of talking about how to solve math problems, it provides some heuristics on how to solve programming problems. *Think Like a Programmer* teaches programming problem solving techniques through the lens of C++ but would still be worth reading for people who are programmers but may not be great at C++.  The book would make for great supplemental reading material for any data structures and algorithms class. It also would be a great reference to use for brushing up on programming interview material.

 From a course standpoint, I finished up [Error Handling in C# with Exceptions][err]. It's a brief course covering exception handling in C#. It's pretty basic but good stuff to review every once in a while. Even on courses  covering subjects I know pretty well already, there's always a chance that they'll unearth a feature that you've overlooked or never even knew about. A language as large as C# has become is full tricks and concepts worth knowing about, it's good to cast a wide net.
