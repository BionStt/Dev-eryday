The reason I started Dev-eryday was to push myself to get better as a software developer everyday. The goal was to do something every single day to get a little further down the path to mastery. Well, I'm into the final month of the first year of this experiment and the results have been pretty good. I'm closer to where I want to be but there's still a long way to go. In effort to help narrow the gap I'm issuing myself a challenge for the month of December. 

## Five Languages in Five Weeks

### Challenge
Learn the basics of five programming languages in five weeks. One week won't be enough to truly learn any of these languages, but it will be enough to get a taste of each language and find out what they excel at. Objectively, the challenge is to do the following for each language: 
- Learn the basic syntax. 
- Identify the strengths and weaknesses.
- Create a "Rosetta Stone" style file with all basic language constructs.
- Complete a basic project.
- Chart out a path for future learning with the language.

### Goal
To get better at rapidly learning new programming languages. In my career I'm going to have to learn a lot of different technologies. The better equipped I am to go through the learning cycle, the better off I'll be in the long run. Use this opportunity to better understand the similarities and differences in programming languages and try to get a sense of what makes a language stand out. Possibly find language worth focusing on.

### Language Schedule
**Week 1 - TypeScript**  
**Week 2 - Elixir**  
**Week 3 - Haskell**  
**Week 4 - Go**  
**Week 5 - Kotlin**  

I picked each of these languages because I have a strong interest in each of them. The fact that they are all fairly trendy right now was a big part too. They also cover a wide range of paradigms and touch practically all types of delivery areas (web, systems, client side, apps, scientific computing, etc). Other languages I strongly considered were Rust and Swift. Haskell is probably the least reasonable language on the list but poses the greatest challenge and growth opportunity. This list isn't set in stone, but I feel good about it.
