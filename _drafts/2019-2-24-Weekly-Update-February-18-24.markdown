After reading two chapters of  *[Code Complete 2][cc]* each day, I'm 30 chapters in and nearly done with the book. I wouldn't say that the book is changing my world, but it's definitely reaffirming lessons I've already learned, sheding new light on problems I hadn't considered, and polishing a lot of concepts I've read or heard about in less formal environments. So far the book as provided an amazing survey of software delivery techiques and ideas and I'm blown away by the breadth. It's amazing the book was published back in 2004 and a lot of the advice is just as applicable today. Many of the ideas have evolved a bit since then, but reading this book back then must have been like reading the future. I just looked at the book's Amazon page and it it mentions that Steve McConnell, the author of *Code Complete 2*, is releasing a new book this spring. It's titled *More Effective Agile: A Roadmap for Leaders* and I'm looking forward to it. Hopefully this new book will be every bit as prescient as *Code Complete 2*.

## On the Next...

This is the week that I will finally finish *Code Complete 2*. If I continue to read two chapters each day, I will finish up the book on Wednesday. That'll be a great step forward in completing a major piece in my 2019 planned readings. At the same time that I get to cross it off the list, it's also added a number of books to my reading list (*The Psychology of Computer Programming*, *Programming on Purpose*) so I'm not any closer to completing it. I'm excited to read these new books though.
