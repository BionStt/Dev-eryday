I finished *[Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design][clean]* this week. The book is a great survey of some important techniques that can be used to create well designed software. Since it's a survey, each section is short and scratches the surface on many topics. Though maybe not as good as *[Clean Code][code]*, *Clean Architecture* is a SOLID read.
