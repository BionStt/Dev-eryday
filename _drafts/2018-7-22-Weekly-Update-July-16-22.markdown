Tony Hsieh is an insanely successful person. His book, *[Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose][hap]*, is a fun read that details the events, beliefs, and practices that got him where he is today. From starting LinkExchange to leading Zappos to a $1.2 billion exit from Amazon, Hsieh has had a wild ride. Selling shoes on the internet isn't something that instantly sounds like a billion dollar idea. Zappos was so successful due to its focus on culture and customer service. The book, which is a great read, features the 10 core values of Zappos. I think they're worth sharing. Each of these core values align well with Dev-eryday and are worth striving for individually, not just within the context of Zappos. Here they are.

1. Deliver WOW Through Service
2. Embrace and Drive Change
3. Create Fun and a Little Weirdness
4. Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded
5. Pursue Growth and Learning
6. Build Open and Honest Relationships with Communication
7. Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit
8. Do More with Less
9. Be Passionate and Determined
10. Be Humble
