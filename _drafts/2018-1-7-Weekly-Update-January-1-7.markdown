 One week down, 51 more to go. I hope everyone had a productive first week of 2018. My first went pretty well. I completed my week with [Swift][swi] and wrapped up the [Five Languages in Five Weeks][fnf] challenge. Learning Swift was awesome. It was the most enjoyable language that I experimented with during the challenge.

 Once the dust settled after finishing Five in Five, it was time to get back into the swing of my regularly scheduled practice.

I want to map out some learning goals for the year over the next couple of weeks. Right now I'm leaning towards having three main focuses: React, C# Mastery, and Machine Learning. I made a ton of forward progress on React in 2017 and I want to continue that by deploying software with in 2018. Beyond that, my time with five different languages reiterated just how great of a language C# is. I want to make a consistant effort to dive deeper into it in 2018. The last area I want to improve on is Machine Learning. It's a broad field with a ton of applications and I studied it a good amount in 2017 but never got too far.
