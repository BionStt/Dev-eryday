Ever since I was a kid, I've always enjoyed solving problems. Through solving lots of mathematical problems I saw my skills improve, but was I as good as I could be? It wasn't until college until I considered the process of how to solve problems. Improving my process could give me an edge. So I was looking at books in the library when I stumbled upon *How to Solve It* by George Polya. This book was exactly what I needed. It had tons of tricks for taking my problem skills to the next level and I couldn't recommend it more. Here's the high level appoach that I use to solve problems, which is largly lifted from Polya's.

Problem Solving Technique
--------------
1. Read and Understand the Problem
  Prior to attempting to solve any problem, it's important to have a complete understanding of what the problem is. Ask any questions you have about it and define anything that doesn't make sense. Become an expert on what the problem is so you can focus on exactly what steps need to be taken to solve it.
2. Plan a Solution
  Have you ever seen a similar problem to the one at hand? If so, adapt the technique from that problem and use it to solve this one. 
3. Implement the Plan
  Follow through on the plan. Sometimes you'll find that your plan won't actually work in this step. That's okay. Review the problem again and make a new plan.
4. Review the process
  Do a full review of what was done to solve the problem. Go back and read through the original question. Do the results satisfy the constraints? Evaluate the implementation against the plan. What could be done differently? What could be done better?
