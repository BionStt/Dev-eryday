[Go][go] wasn't really what I expected it to be. I came into the language thinking it would be a standard object oriented programming language like C# or Java. Go is a lot closer to C than either of those two programming languages. That makes sense as Go was orginally created to fix some of the short comings of C. Go is a modern, fully featured language that has a lot going for it.

Go is quite a change of pace from the last two weeks which featured Elixir and Haskell. Both Elixir and Haskell were functional languages with immutable objects. Go is imperative and allows state updates. 

### Procedural, Flexible, Fast
Go is flexible. It's compiled, statically typed with advanced type inference, and supports concurrent programming.

### Further Learning Plans
I would like to dig further into Go in the future. I would say that it's my second favorite language from the challenge, behind Elixir, so far. 

### Resources
I was able to pull from a few resources to learn Go this week.

*[The Go Programming Language][tgp]* by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan. This book is the best way to deeply learn Go.  
[Go Fundamentals][gof] by Nigel Poulton. Perfect course to get up to speed on the basics of Go quickly.  
[Object-Oriented Programming with Go][oogo] by Martin Van Sickle. This course shows how Go developers can take advantage of object-oriented ideas within their code. This is a very interesting course.  

### Quick Final Thoughts
Programming in Go is a very enjoyable experience.
