I've now got a full year check in streak on GitHub. It started back last September when I started building SimpleHealthTracking. Lately I've been getting a lot of check ins from the React Nanodegree program. The streak has ben an amazing chance to commit a daily practice. The streak pushes me keep at it day in and day out. Some days are more productive than others, but as long as there is a little progress each day the process is working.

This week I completed the the [Advanced Defensive Programming Techniques][adp] course. The course was great. On the React front, the React Native portion of the [React Nanodegree][rnd] went live. I'm working my way through it and currently a couple of sections in.

Finished
--------
**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Advanced Defensive Programming Techniques][adp]

Currents
--------
**Course(s):** [React Nanodegree][rnd]

**Pluralsight Course(s):** [Implementing and Securing an API with ASP.NET Core][core], [Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect][secure], 

**Book(s):** *[Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns][sbp]*, *[Tao of Seneca: Volume 2][tao]*

On the Next...
--------
I will continue forward with the React Native portion of the [React Nanodegree][rnd] this week. I'd like to finish course material if at all possible. It's awesome how React skills can be taken from the web and directly onto mobile devices. Learn once, write anywhere is a definite advantage. I'm interested in digging in further to determine how well React Native compares to building apps with a tool like Xamarin or to standard native apps.
