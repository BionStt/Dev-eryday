I've been reading *[The Brothers Karamazov: A Novel in Four Parts][brk]* all year, but it feels longer than that. It's a long book, but that's a really long time for me to be reading a book. I'm usually finishing a book after a week or two, but not this one. Coming in at 825 pages, *The Brothers Karamazov* is a true epic novel. The novel is brilliant and covers so much ground. It's philosophical tour de force, covering ethics, morals, faith, and so much more. Centering on the three Karamazov brother, their father, and the people they associate with, the book is set in 18th century Russia. The relationships and dynamics between the brothers make for the perfect setting to consider deep, universal themes.
