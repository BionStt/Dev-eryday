I got a new toy this week. For the last month or so I've been wanting to get an [iPad Pro][pro]. I finally broke down and bought it. I'm planning to use the device as an idea and learning machine. Another strong reason for wanting it was so I can use it as a mobile secondary monitor when I'm on the go. I haven't spent enough time with it to say anything definitive about it yet, but both the device and the Apple Pencil are compelling tools. I'm currently using it to prototype some potential logos and the transition from writing on paper to writing on a tablet has been smoother than I thought possible.

This week I'm going to continue playing with iPad. Now that I have the iPad it'd be nice to get back into doing some stuff with React Native. It was a lot of fun using it as part of the React Nanodegree program and I'd like to get deeper into it.
