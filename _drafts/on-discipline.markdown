Discipline is one of the most powerful skills a person can develop. In fact, discipline is so powerful that practically all things worth obtaining can be acquired through practicing it. Regardless of how potent a tool discipline is, it is a skill that society tends to condition out of us. From instant gratification from the apps on our cell phones, to eating fast food, to watching videos on demand, the modern world and discipline are constantly at odds. Luckily, discipline is a skill that we can develop. Through a lot of practice and even more patience and determination, discipline can be built.

Building discipline is not an easy task. It's a continual process, one I'll probably never master myself, but it's worth every second spent working on it.

Having discipline is like a super power. So few people have it these days that it makes those who do extra effective. Discipline is a choice that we have to make every day. Questions that we have to answer are often ones where we choose between comfort or discomfort. Questions like:

Should I sleep in or get up early to get a head start on the day?
Should I watch TV or read a book?
Should I play this video game or create a new video game?
Should I sit down and relax after work or do a strenuous workout?

All of these questions have a clear, rational answer as to which one is the healthier long term choice.
