Forward. Every single day is a chance to move closer to the desired destination. If I don't take action today, that's going to diminish the chance that I reach my goal tomorrow, and assure that I won't reach it today. Right now, this moment that's passing, is gone as soon as I press the key on my keyboard. You're reading this at some point in my future, which has now became your present. Welcome to now. If everything has gone as planned, I've been putting my time to use. Slowly, but surely, constantly moving forward.

I read a lot this week. Most of it had nothing to do with software development, but I feel like I learned a lot of things that will have a profound effect on my wellbeing. First of all, I finished *[Waking Up][wu]* by Sam Harris. It's a book about spirituality through the lens of meditation and conscienceness. It's a fascinating read, one that can serve as a gateway to many interesting ideas. Once I was done with *[Waking Up]* it was time to start *[12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos][rul]* by Jordan Peterson. I've been waiting for this book to come out for months. It's finally here and I'm really enjoying it. There's a ton about psychology, human nature, biology, and so much more.
