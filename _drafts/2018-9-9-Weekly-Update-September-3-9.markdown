In last week's Weekly Update I mentioned that I've started a challenge to run 100 miles in the month of September. I started the week off with 15 miles in the books. After a 5 mile run on Tuesday, a 7.5 mile run on Thursday, and X miles on Saturday, I'm up to a total of Y miles. The run early in the week was hot but luckily the weather cooled off a bit towards the end of the week which made the trials far more manageable. So far, this has been the most difficult challenge I've taken accepted this calendar year.
