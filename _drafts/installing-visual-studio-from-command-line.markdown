After using Visual Studio daily for over five years, it's nice to still be able to learn new tricks to use it better. It's a rich, expansive development environment that can do almost anything. While troubleshooting a installation problem with the latest production version of VS (VS 2015: Update 3) I found the installation instructions on [MSDN][msd]. At the very bottom of the page, in the "Related Topics" section, there's a link that says, "Use Command-Line Parameters to Install Visual Studio." That link will take you to this [page][command] discussing the available options for installing VS from the command line.
