It looks like Pluralsight has added a [React path][path]. I've already worked through a couple of the courses but I'd like to get through each course in the path. It's important to learn from several different resources, otherwise you might miss out on some things. Once I've went through all of the courses I'll work through the assessment and see where I could use improvement.

Working with Elixir has been a lot of fun.

I started reading the book *[Musashi][mus]. I'm only a couple of chapters in but the story is strong.
