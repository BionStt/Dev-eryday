I spent a good amount of time this week trying to complete a write on the [SignalR Chat App][src]. It's coming together, but it has been slow going. Due to the sloth like pace, I wasn't able to hit my goal of publishing a couple of posts this week. You'll have to settle for just this weekly update. Don't worry too much though, I should have the Chat App post done sometime early in the week ahead. As slow as it's coming together, the time I've spent on it has been enjoyable. I would like to do more posts like it in the months to come. Next time I have to do the write up while building the software. That way everything is documented while it's fresh. Every step in the development process could be recorded and then the post could be heavily edited once the build phase is complete. Doing everything at the end is not optimal, but it is still workable.

Pluralsight released another cool .NET Core course this week. They've really been a good steward in my adoption of Microsoft's updated framework. The new course was Kevin Dockz' [Building an Async API with ASP.NET Core][async]. The title says it all. For anyone wanting a nice survey of how, why, and best practices to building an API utilizing ASP.NET Core's async feature the course is a perfect place to start. async provides a means to make more efficient and horizontally scalable apps.

## On the Next...

The goal for the next week is to get back in the swing of things. Something exceptional happened over the last weekend. I didn't have any access to the internet. I had my computer and was able to read, learn, and create a little bit, but it was the first time in years I've been offline for a couple of days in what feels like years. I have to say, it felt great to take a bit of a break from the constant bombardment of information that is flowing on the internet. I looked at the lack of access as an opportunity to take a minor break. Sure, it changed my plans for weekend, but it was nothing major. So I'm going to take the little break and use it hit next week even harder.
