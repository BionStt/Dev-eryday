Today I will get one percent better at X. Tomorrow I will get one percent better at X...After N tomorrows ([where N = 72][st]) I will have doubled my performance in X. The things we learn, much like our bank and 401k accounts, can take advantage of compound interest. James Altucher has a process where he improves by [one percent][op] every day. After reading Altucher's post, I thought about all of the times when I was at peak productivity. The times when learning felt easy or when code was just flowing through my fingers into the text editor. All of these times were the product of sustained effort spanning many consecutive days. Small impacts over time build into huge returns in the long run.

Whenever I'm at a loss for what to reseach or what to learn next, I ask myself a simple question: What will make me one percent better at X? Once I find this out I dig in. Often through finding what will take me through the next percent will also uncover what will take me through the next ten percent or more. That's the thing about knowledge, getting a little bit opens up the door to a lot more. Given enough time, one percent explodes into ten and ten explodes one hundred and so on it goes.

We can apply the idea of getting one percent better to any facet of life. Through eating right, exercising, sleeping enough, and countless other healthy behaviors, I can get one percent healthier every day for the rest of my life.

Just like we can take advantage of compounding for improvement, our skills can also stagnate or regress quickly through the same process. Every day we don't improve breaks the momentum.

I'm now officially a month into the Dev-eryday experiment. I will keep on building my skills to get at least one percent better every day. Improving every day is the whole spirit of this challenge and I'm continuously improving. World renowned abilities are not built in a matter of days.
