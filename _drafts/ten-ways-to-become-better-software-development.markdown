Lately I've been making lists of ideas. These ideas can be about anything. My target this week has been to create a list of ten ideas around a central theme every day. Today, I made a list of ten ways to become a better software developer. I will present the list with a brief summary of ways to go about each item. At some I might have to explore some of the items further in more fleshed out posts.

Ten Ways to Become a Better Software Developer
--------
1. Learn a New Language

 
2. Read Source Code

    Read the source code from an open source project you've used before. Maybe it's a JavaScript library you've used or API you're curious about. Think about the problem the code solves and envision your solution to the problem. Compare your potential solution to the one that is used in the implementation.
3. Build Something

 
4. Take a Course

 
5. Read About Software/CS Ideas

 
6. Teach/Help Others

 
7. Contribute to an Open Source Project

 
8. Record Your Ideas
 

9. Practice

 
10. Share Gratitude

 

There are so many ways to get better at software development. This is just a simple list I put together in a few minutes, largely centered around techniques I've used or have read about.
