Wow, four months of Dev-eryday have already gone by! It's always remarkable how fast the time goes by when you're focused and on task. One thing that really stands out about this project has been that when I look at a narrow timeframe, like day to day, it doesn't appear like a whole lot is happening. As the window gets pulled back and the we look at the progress that occurs accross weeks or months though, the growth starts to look more profound. Remember, the process of improvement is a continuous cycle. Keep at it and good things will happen.

On the Next...
--------
I should find another MOOC course to work on the week ahead. There are so many great courses out there to take. Even if I don't finish the courses, just auditing the material has been worthwhile in helping to generate ideas and expose the mind to new thoughts.
