I did it. I finally caved in and bought a standing desk. Well, not exactly a standing desk, but an adjustable desk that can be used while either sitting or standing. Amazon was running a sale and I was able to pick up the [Halter ED-600][desk] for around $150.00. I've only been using the desk for week, but I'm very happy with it so far.

I'm no doctor, but I've heard it be said a few times that sitting is not very good for us. There are a ton of scare articles out there, like this one entitled ["Sitting Will Kill You, Even if You Exercise"][sit], yet many software developers sit for the majority of their waking hours. Now, I don't think sitting is going to kill me any time soon, but it's definitely something that will impact my life at some point down the road. I hope to dodge the adverse effects of sitting through utilizing the standup feature of the desk as much as possible.

My target schedule for my first week as been been to stand at least double time as much as I sit. My target sit/stand ratio has been as follows:
    
    * 8:30 - 9:30 Stand
    * 9:30 - 10:00 Sit
    * 10:00 - 11:00 Stand
    * 11:00 - 11:30 Sit
    * 11:30 - 12:00 Stand
    * 12:00 - 13:00 Lunch
    * 13:00 - 13:30 Stand
    * 13:30 - 14:00 Sit
    * 14:00 - 15:00 Stand
    * 15:00 - 15:30 Sit
    * 15:30 - 16:30 Stand
    * 16:30 - 17:00 Sit

This schedule is a little ambitious. It's been a little bit of a challenge to stand up this much. The body definitely requires an adjustment to standing when you've spent so much time. I wouldn't say I'm hurting but I can feel some tiredness in my not only my leg muscles but also in neck and back.

All in all, I recommend all developers pick up a convertable desk or do something to cut down on the amount of time spent sitting.
