Discipline is one of the most powerful skills a person can develop. In fact, discipline is so powerful that practically all things worth obtaining can be acquired through practicing it. Regardless of how potent a tool discipline is, it is a skill that society tends to condition out of us. From instant gratification from the apps on our cell phones, to eating fast food, to watching videos on demand, the modern world and discipline are constantly at odds. Luckily, discipline is a skill that we can develop. Through a lot of practice and even more patience and determination, discipline can be built.

First, let's recognize what exactly discipline is through an example. Discipline is the practice of doing what is best regardless of what you want to do. Sometimes I don't want to get up and go to work in the morning. That's natural, and all of us feel like this from time to time. By pushing through this block and going to work I exercise discipline. Once I'm there, I might as well get as much work done as possible. Every piece I complete now is one I won't have to worry about later. From making the single choice of going to work the discipline had a compounding effect. The more barriers I push through, the easier the next barrier is to break down. Had I not shown up to work, none of work I was supposed to do would have gotten down. Since I pushed through and made it there, I built upon the effort already exerted and continued pushing through the pain.

Building discipline is not an easy task. It's a continual process, one I'll probably never master myself, but it's worth every second spent working on it. So how do we build discipline? We push through the difficult times! Here's a list of techniques and ideas I've used to improve my discipline.

Steps to Take to Improve Discipline
---------

1. **Commit to a Set of Habits**
    
    Commit to the things that are important, make time for these habits no matter what. Persistence pays off.
2. **Push Through the Discomfort**
    
    Practicing discipline often requires us to overcome barriers, push through these.
3. **Know that You're Strong Enough**

    Believe that you can stick to whatever practice you've set your mind to.
4. **Wait**
       
   Progress won't happen immediately, learn to enjoy the wait.
5. **Make Decisions Based on What's Right, Not What's Easy**

   There's beauty in the struggle. True growth is often waiting at the end of the process.
6. **Don't Give In**

    Desire is always temporary.
7. **Surround Yourself with Others Who Are Disciplined**

   The people who you're surrounded by have a ton of influence on you. Choose these people wisely.
8. **Know that Everyone Fails Sometimes**

    We're all imperfect, don't obsess over slip ups. 
9. **Remove Distractions**

    Remove things that are clear triggers. There's no reason to have negative influences around.
10. **Don't Rely on Motivation**

    Motivation isn't required for action. Sometimes you only have enough energy to go through the motions, that's okay. Going through the motions builds the momentum required to get to the good stuff.
11. **Challenge Yourself**

    Push the limits of what you can do.  

Having discipline is like a super power. So few people have it these days that it makes those who do have it extra effective. Discipline is a choice that we have to make in basically every thing we do. Questions that we have to answer are often ones where we choose between comfort or discomfort. Questions like:

* Should I sleep in or get up early to get a head start on the day?
* Should I watch TV or read a book?
* Should I play this video game or create something new?
* Should I sit down and relax after work or do a strenuous workout?

All of these questions have a clear, rational answer as to which one is the healthier long term choice. Unfortunately, the right answer is rarely an easy one. The right answer is often serveral degrees of magnitude harder than the easy one. The right answer is easier to reach through practicing discipline. This is why it's so important to cultivate the ability.
