I got my [myreads][reads] project completed. I originally submitted it on Monday morning but it was not accepted on the first attempt. My readme.md file did not meet the rubric so I had to resubmit. After updating the file to better meet the requirements the project was accepted. It's onto the Redux section now. I'm going to try to jump on the new content in the same way that I did with the fundamentals section.

Pluralsight added a course that I've been waiting a couple of months for. The course I've been waiting for was [Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect][secure]. I've been waiting for this because I'm interested in using .NET Core to build a secure web services. I would like to build many tools using React and React Native on the front end and .NET Core for the backend. I'm going to apply the concepts from the React Nanodegree and the .NET Core content from Pluralsight to create a ton of new tools. I've only just started the course, but the material I've seen so far has been great.
