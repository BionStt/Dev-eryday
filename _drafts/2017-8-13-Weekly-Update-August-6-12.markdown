I got my [myreads][reads] project completed. I originally submitted it on Monday morning but it was not accepted on the first attempt. My readme.md file did not meet the standards of the rubric so I had to resubmit. The reviewer noted that all of the functionality was there, I just need to make sure to get the readme.md in order. After updating the file to better meet the requirements the project was accepted. It's onto the Redux section now. I'm going to try to jump on the new content in the same way that I did with the fundamentals section.

Pluralsight added a course that I've been waiting a couple of months for. The course I've been waiting for was [Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect][secure]. I've been waiting for this because I'm interested in using .NET Core to build a secure web services. I would like to build many tools using React and React Native on the front end and .NET Core for the backend. I'm going to apply the concepts from the React Nanodegree and the .NET Core content from Pluralsight to create a ton of new tools. I've only just started the course, but the material I've seen so far has been great. I'm going to take my time through the course and implement each step by hand to maximize the learning process.

Finished
--------
**PluralSight Course(s):** [Advanced React.js][arjs]

**Book(s):** *[Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems][micro]*

Currents
--------
**Course(s):** [React Nanodegree][rnd]

**PluralSight Course(s):** [Implementing and Securing an API with ASP.NET Core][core], [Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect][secure]

**Book(s):** *[Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns][sbp]*, *[Tao of Seneca][tao]*

On the Next...
--------
I'm on pace to finish up the React and Redux course material early next week. Once I've completed it, I will start in earnest on the next project.

Another thing I want to dive deeper into is the [Gatsby][gats] static site generator. With all the knowledge I'm accumulating about React, it's fitting that I'd start exploring Gatsby. Currently, dev-eryday is built using Jekyll. I haven't pushed myself to learn much beyond the basics of that static site generator though. Gatsby is a perfect match to take skills I already have further and to potentially improve dev-eryday. That's a huge win.
