Lots of learning this week, as always. 

In addition to working through numerous courses on Pluralsight, I've been trying to pick up the game of chess. Growing up I never really played the game much but I'm currently fascinated by it. The game is so deep and complex. Right now I'm using [lichess][lc] to learn how to play the game and mostly compete against the AI in games.

On the MOOC front, I started a new course on Coursera called [Mastering the Software Engineering Interview][se]. I've seen that there are books on this topic, like *Cracking the Coding Interview*, but I've never seen the content covered from the perspective of a university course. I'm through all the content from the first week and it's high-quality sof far. The course does not actually let non-paying customers complete the exercises so there will be no formal completion for me. Luckily I'm more interested in the course material than I'm am in actually completing it.
