I'm an unabashed fan of the Pluralsight training website. Not only does it have great learning material, but it also has an unrivaled selection of content. In the realm of training, it's like if Netflix combined with Prime and HBO Go to form one super video streaming site. Pluralsight is a fantastic resource. Lately, I've been watching the course, "Making Your C# Code More Object Oriented." It's an amazing course, one that I recommend highly. Here is a brief summary of what it covers.

This was an amazing course with a ton of ideas that need to be examined further for complete understanding. I will be working through and thinking about this material in the weeks to come. I'm planning on doing some major refactorings on my SimpleHealthTracking code to take advantage of some of the techniques presented in the course.
