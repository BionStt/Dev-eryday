I never really set any concrete learning goals for 2017. When I started Dev-eryday, all I knew was that I want to build up my skillset and get better each day. This process has been a lot of fun and I've learned a great deal so far. Now that I'm two plus months into the project, I feel like it's time to throw out some more quantifiable targets. Simply learning for learning's sake is too open ended to achieve extreme results. The only way, if there even is a way, to learn five year's worth of material in six months is to go about it in a pragmatic way.

Things I Want to Learn or Improve At
----------- 

C# and .NET - This is my bread and butter skill. There is power in making a strength even stronger.

JavaScript - JS is every where and it's growing every day. I want to take my skills in the language from average to exceptional. The utility of JavaScript on the modern web is unparalled.

Elixir - Last summer I spent a few night's playing with Elixir. The time spent playing with the language was a total joy. For some reason I didn't stick with it back then, I wish I would have never stopped. I'd have a major leg up on the language now. Since it's always a good idea to pick up a language each year, Elixir will be the language I learn this year.

Front End Skills - I want to deliver a lot of software, the best way to make people want to use it is to make it look nice.

Software Delivery Practices - Improving dev ops type skills makes life so much easier. I'm also going to lump software engineering practices into this. So many great books have been written on the subject. 

Algorithms - Algorithms are a timeless skill. No matter what happens in the next 1000 years, algorithm design techniques will always be relevant in problem solving.

Database - I use SQL Server every day, leveling up these abilities would be immensely useful
