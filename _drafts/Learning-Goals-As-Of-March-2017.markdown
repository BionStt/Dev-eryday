I never really set any concrete learning goals for 2017. When I started Dev-eryday, all I knew was that I want to build up my skillset and get better each day. This process has been a lot of fun and I've learned a great deal so far. Now that I'm two months into the project, I feel like it's time to throw out a more stable target. Simply learning for learning's sake is too open ended to achieve extreme results. The only way to learn 5 year's worth of material in 6 months is to go about it in a pragmatic way.
