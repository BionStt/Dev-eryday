The more things I do, the more I realize that consistency is the strongest indicator of whether or not the venture will go well. My best results have been found through committing to a practice and repeatedly progressing forward. The key seems to be relentlessly sticking with whatever the practice is. Sure, I could take a day off, but then I'd be a day further from the destination. There's no reason to put off for tomorrow what I can accomplish today. In cases where I find myself taking more days off than days with progress, it's usually a signal that I'm not committed enough to that thing. It's important to recognize these situations as soon as possible and to either correct them or pivot away from the practice entirely.

This was a solid week for continuing forward with React. I finished the [Building Scalable React Apps][re] course on Pluralsight. The course is a fantastic overview on building a HackerNews/Reddit-like link aggregation service. After completing it and several other React tutorials on Pluralsight, I can say that this is my favorite React course on the site.
