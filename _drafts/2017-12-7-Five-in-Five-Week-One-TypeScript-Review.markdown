Wow, that went quick! [TypeScript][ts] is a great programming language. I feel like I could be productive in it right now. Picking TypeScript as the first language in my Five Languages in Five Weeks journey was the best possible choice. TypeScript allowed me to ease into the challenge. The language was comfortable to use from the first LOC.

All in all, I'd estimate that I spent 10 to 15 hours learning about and writing TypeScript code this week. 

### Similarity to C# and JavaScript
Comfort made the language easier to pick up.

The level of comfort was great for getting up to speed quickly, but it also led to me checking out a little bit after the first couple of days.

### Further Learning Plan

### Resources

### Quick Final Thoughts
I think that I will be using TypeScript in the future. Since the language was create by [Anders Hejlsberg][ah], a creator of C#, Turbo Pascal, and Delphi, I had high hopes going in. I was not at all disappointed. TypeScript, though more verbose than JavaScript, is a clear improvement in a lot of cases. By letting the compiler enforce boundaries on the objects, functions, and classes we create, TypeScript protects us from making hard to find errors.
