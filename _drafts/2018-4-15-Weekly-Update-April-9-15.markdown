It's amazing to read about the about the people at the top of any field. From the best investors to the great writers, there are talented folks who rise to the top of their craft. Software development is no exception. This week I spent a lot of time reading *[Coder's at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming][wo]* by Peter Seibel which interviews several such software developers. Though there are many differences between the interview subjects, there are many common threads that lead to success as a coder. It's clear that these developers all share a profound sense of curiosity. It was also common for the interviewees to have started programming while they were young, like they were naturally drawn to the computer.

One question that Seibel typically asked the participants stuck with me. The question was about each coder's experience with Donald Knuth's classic series *[The Art of Computer Programming][taocp]*. The series is a vast overview of computer science, and is no walk in the park to work through. I was surprised that the majority not only had Knuth's volumes on their bookshelves, but had also read through the entire set and completed the exercises. Reading through *The Art of Computer Programming* is no small task for anybody, world class developers included. Amazon says that the set has 3168 pages. That means that if I start reading five pages every day I can complete the set in a little under two years. I feel like that would be time well spent.
