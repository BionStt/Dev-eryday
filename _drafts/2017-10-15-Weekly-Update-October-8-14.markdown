I was able to finish the [Getting Started with ASP.NET Core and OAuth][core2] on Pluralsight. The course provides a practical look at how to use [IdentityServer4][is4] with ASP.NET Core. IdentityServer4 makes it easy to produce authentication using OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 via ASP.NET Core 2. On top of showing the ins and outs of how to use IdentityServer4, it also shows how to integrate Google Authentication and Auth0 into the mix. It's a very cool course and I'll be using its content to build some cool stuff.

I didn't work on the [Mobile FlashCards][mf] app nearly as much time as I thought I would this week. With all the playoff baseball I didn't get to focus on it like I thought I would. The Cubs winning their series with the Nationals was a double edged sword. On one hand I'm happy they won but on the other if they lose I have more time to produce and learn. Either way it's a good situation to have. I will carve out a little more time this week and make progress on the app.
