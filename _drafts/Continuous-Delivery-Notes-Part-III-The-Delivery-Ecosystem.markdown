Released in 2010, Jez Humble and Dave Farley's *[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]* has become the go to resource for teaching software developers about deploying software.

If you want to read more about the subject of continuous delivery or any of the chapters, pick up *[Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation][cd]*. It's a fantastic book. Sure, it was released in 2010, but the concepts included are still applicable and foster good software delivery practices. The book delves far further into each of these subjects and is worth picking up if you enjoyed these notes.
