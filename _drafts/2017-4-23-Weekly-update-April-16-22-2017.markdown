Possibly the only problem I have with Pluralsight is that they add too many courses I want to watch. That is a truly great problem to have! This week they added a course called [What Every Developer Must Know About HTTPS][https] by Troy Hunt. The course is a fantastic overview of the HTTPS technology and covers not only how to take advantage of it, but also how to do it for free and in a way that makes your site at least as fast as HTTP.
