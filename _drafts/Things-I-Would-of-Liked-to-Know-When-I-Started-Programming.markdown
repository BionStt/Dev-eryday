It's hard for me to believe this, but I've been programming for over ten years now. It feels like just yesterday I was sitting in 1st period Computer Science learning C++ back in high school. I remember very little of the actual code from that class and haven't touched C++ in years, but it set the foundation for the knowledge that came after. Here I'm going to identify some of the things I wish I knew back when I was starting out. I'll also cite some tools that would have made my journey a lot easier. This cheat sheet would've saved me many hours. Hopefully this post will help guide a few new developers down the right path.

Basic Language Concepts
--------
Most of programming can be boiled down to a few basic patterns. If you learn these well, you can do anything with code. Each of these concepts are fundamental to modern programming. If you are comfortable with these topics you can get productive in almost any codebase.

*Variables

*Types

*Functions

*Classes

*Objects

*Collections

*Loops

*Boolean Logic

Languages Worth Knowing
---------
Any programming language is worth knowing, but there are a few that are more relevant than others. Really though, as long as you settle on learning one, there is no wrong descision when starting out. Don't get caught up in trying to find the perfect language to learn. There is no perfect language. Luckily, for us programmers, there are a lot of great ones. Here are the four I'd recommend to younger me, learning any of these will open up a world of possibilities.

JavaScript

C#

Java

Python


Tools and Subjects That Are Essential
---------
These are the tools that you'll need to pick up in order to be a productive professional. School might not teach these but by learning them you can seperate yourself from the pack.

Text Editor - I prefer to use Visual Studio Code nowadays.

Source Control

CSS

SQL

HTML

Bootstrap

Testing

Problem Solving

Databases

Comfort in Discomfort


Books
---------
There are so many books out there to read. I've spent countless hours curating a library of books that will bring the best knowledge to time ratio.


Sites to Use
---------
There are three major types of sites developers can use to advance their position:
  1. Web Presence - These are sites that can be used to advertise yourself.
  2. Question and Answer - Sites where you go to get answers, feedback, and test your own answering skills.
  3. Learning - Blogs, documentation websites, online courses, etc. 

In order to maximize knowledge and potential, you need to use each resource. Not only will it make you a better developer, but they will help push your career forward. Some of the sites fall into multiple catagories. That's a signal that you should concentrate the majority of your online time and energy there.

Tips
--------
Always have something you're actively learning.

Always have a personal project.

Always have a book you're reading.


Save everything in OneNote or a similar notation app.

DSSS Method of Learning

Deconstruction

Selection

Spacing

Stakes

Goal
--------
When I was younger I didn't have a focused goal or set of habits that kept me on the right path. I would read a lot and try to improve but I learned mostly due to assigned work. If I were to do it over again, I'd have a one goal.

Goal: Make time to know more each day. Build up knowledge every day. Recognize that there is an amazing amount of stuff to learn, but don't get overwhelmed, just take it one piece at a time.

Assigned work, be it through school or your job, often won't be enough to sustain continual growth. It's imperative to take your own initiative to learn the material you want to know. Make a habit of pushing yourself and it'll pay off. Make sure to do your best at the assigned work, but sprinkle in the some improvement every time you get a chance.
