I don't really care too much about politics, but when a book as talked about as Michael Wolff's *[Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House][fire]* comes out, you almost have to check it out. I spent a good part of my week with the bestselller this week. If it were fiction, the book would be a fun read, but if you take it as truth it comes off looking sad. The book is window in to how the Trump adminstration is allegely running the show in DC. Whether you love Trump or not, the book is worth reading. I have to admit, it was severly lacking on information about software development though. I want details about the variation of agile that Steve Bannon used to win the election or some of Jared Kushner's thoughts on using machine learning to plan out Trump rally locations. Maybe it'll come in the follow-up.
