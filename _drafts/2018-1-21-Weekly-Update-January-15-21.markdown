I'm trying a new thing where I have an image in all my weekly updates. Below is the first Weekly Update Image. It's a little branding for Dev-eryday. I've been getting better each day, so I put that idea into a little logo. I hope it inspires you to get a little bit better today.

I don't really care too much about politics, but when a book as talked about as Michael Wolff's *[Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House][fire]* comes out, you almost have to check it out. I spent a good part of my week with the bestselller this week. If it were fiction, the book would be a fun read, but if you take it as truth it comes off looking sad. The book is window in to how the Trump adminstration is allegely running the show in DC. Whether you love Trump or not, the book is worth reading. I have to admit, it was severly lacking on information about software development though. I want details about the variation of agile that Steve Bannon used to win the election or some of Jared Kushner's thoughts on using machine learning to plan out Trump rally locations. Maybe it'll come in the follow-up.

I continued my survey of the Azure product suite. This week I learned about Microsoft's cloud solution for Artificial Intelligence solutions in [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services: Big Picture][mac] on Pluralsight. The course was brief, clocking in at around an hour, but contained a lot of information about Azure's cognitive services offering. It's really amazing that you can take your own data and send it off to Microsoft for all your analysis needs. From inferring the contents to images, to chat bots, to voice dictation, there are a ton of robust services services available. Algorithms as a service can add huge functionality with little development cost.

I'm diving head first into React this week. I haven't touched since I got the React Nanodegree and I'm wanting to get back into it. I've been building out the web service for the IdeaListz application I want to launch and it's getting to be time to start developing the client side. It's going to be a fun week.
