With all the time I spend working through Pluralsight courses, it makes sense that I've thought about how to get the most out of the experience. Pluralsight is a great resource that can be used to improve your skills in almost any technology sub-topic.

Watch the Videos
Slow down the speed and rewatch the important bits.
Review Slides Several Times
Look at the slides and rewatch the videos at the same time.
Write up a summary about every section of the course. You can even use the note feature within the site.
Think about places where you can use the techniques you learned about. Apply them in the real world.
Take the Learning Check exams.
Implement the projects the instructors work through yourself.
Plan to spend at least double the running time of the videos on working through the course.

Sometimes you don't really want to work through the course with your full attention. I've often viewed entire courses for the single purpose of auditing the material just to get an overview of the subject. In this case, I like to watch the course at 1.5x speed. It's fast, but not too fast. This is more efficient and I can always stop and slow the video down whenever the subject requires extra attention.
