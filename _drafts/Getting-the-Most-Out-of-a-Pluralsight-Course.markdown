With all the time I spend working through [Pluralsight][pl] courses, it makes sense that I've thought about how to get the most out of the experience. Pluralsight is a great resource that can be used to improve your skills in almost any technology sub-topic. From web development to security to design to CAD skills, there are courses for almost any skill tangentially or directly related to software. Here are some tips I'm using to make my time spent working through Pluralsight courses as effective as possible.

**Watch the Videos**
######
Give your full attention to whatever video you're watching. Slow down the speed and rewatch the important bits where needed. It's almost impossible to learn anything new if your mind is focused on other things. Try to be completely present with the video. Close potentially distracting tabs.

**Download Course Material**
######
Download the course material for the course. The course material usually contains the slides used throughout the course and Before/After versions for each section of a code-focused course. It's nice to have the 

**Review Slides Several Times**
######
Before viewing a section, take a look at the slides. When the section is complete, look over the slides again. Add notes where appropriate. Another way to use the slides is to look at the slides and rewatch the videos at the same time. This active form of learning can help solidify the content.

**Enable Subtitles**
######
If the video has subtitles, make sure they're turned on. I often will listen to the instructor's voice and read the subtitles at the same time in order to reinforce the content. The subtitles also provide clarification on exactly what is said. Note that sometimes the newer content will not yet have subtitles. If the course is something absolutely are dying to learn don't wait for the subtitles.

**Summarize the Material**
######
Write up a summary about every section of the course. You can even use the note feature within the site.

**Apply the Knowledge**
######
Think about places where you can use the techniques you learned about. Apply them in the real world.

**Test Yourself**
######
Take the Learning Check exams. Even better, write questions up for yourself and find the answers.

**Follow Along with the Project**
######
Implement the projects the instructors work through yourself.
Plan to spend at least double the running time of the videos on working through the course.

**Race Through Courses for Enrichment or Review**
######
Sometimes you don't really want to work through the course with your full attention. I've often viewed entire courses for the single purpose of auditing the material just to get an overview of the subject. Other times I've blitzed through a course to review material I alreadly know. In these cases, I like to watch the course at 1.5x speed. It's fast, but not too fast. This is more efficient and I can always stop and slow the video down whenever the subject requires extra attention.

These are some of the techniques I've found to get the most out of my Pluralsight subscription.
